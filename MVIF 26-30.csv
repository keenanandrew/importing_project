COMEBin utilizes data augmentation to generate multiple fragments (views) of each contig and obtains high-quality embeddings of heterogeneous features (sequence coverage and k-mer distribution) through contrastive learning. Experimental results on multiple simulated and real datasets demonstrate that COMEBin outperforms state-of-the-art binning methods, particularly in recovering near-complete genomes from real environmental samples. COMEBin outperforms other binning methods remarkably when integrated into metagenomic analysis pipelines, including the recovery of potentially pathogenic antibiotic-resistant bacteria (PARB) and moderate or higher quality bins containing potential biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs).

The ability to identify adaptations common to many host gut microbiomes would not only reveal shared selection pressures across hosts, but also key drivers of functional differentiation of the microbiome that may affect community structure and host traits. However, to date there has not been a systematic scan for adaptations that have spread across host microbiomes. Here, we develop a novel selection scan statistic, named the integrated linkage disequilibrium score (iLDS), that can detect the spread of adaptive haplotypes across host microbiomes via migration and horizontal gene transfer. Specifically, iLDS leverages signals of hitchhiking of deleterious variants with the beneficial variant, a common feature of adaptive evolution.

Childhood mortality due to acute diarrhea (AD; less than 7 days of duration) is decreasing, but prolonged (ProD; 7-13 days of duration) and persistent (PD; more than 14 days of duration) diarrhea combined (ProPD) are responsible for increased morbidity and mortality in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs).
Objectives: This study aimed to characterize the gut microbiota (GM) composition of children with acute diarrhea (AD) and prolonged or persistent diarrhea (ProPD) by comparing GM composition between these two groups and with non-diarrheal controls in a case-control study.
Methods: The study included fecal samples from 1321 children 0-59 months old. After preprocessing based on sequencing depth, we analyzed the GM of 1313 children comparing 554 AD cases, 95 ProPD cases, and 663 frequency matched, non-diarrheal controls. All children were enrolled from Jimma, Ethiopia. The GM composition was determined using 16S rRNA gene (V4 region) amplicon sequencing. The observed zero-radius Operational Taxonomic Units (zOTUs) and Shannon diversity index were assessed, and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity metrics were generated and differences between groups evaluated by PERMANOVA. DESeq2 was used to determine taxa being differentially abundant between diarrhea subcategories and non-diarrheal controls.
Results: All diarrhea cases (AD and ProPD) combined and each group separately were associated with a decrease in bacterial diversity compared to non-diarrheal controls. Relative to non-diarrheal controls, the GM of children with AD or ProPD was enriched in Escherichia spp., Campylobacter spp., and Streptococcus spp. The GM of children with AD or ProPD was characterized by a decreased relative abundance of Prevotella copri, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Dialister succinatiphilus compared to non-diarrheal controls. Similarly, compared to AD cases, ProPD cases were characterized by a decreased relative abundance of important gut commensals such as F. prausnitzii, Akkermansia muciniphila, Eubacterium hadrum and Blautia spp.
Conclusion: The GM of children with AD and ProPD was enriched in putative pathogens as well as facultative anaerobes, while obligate anaerobes were reduced. The GM of children with ProPD was characterized by a more pronounced reduction of obligate anaerobic gut commensals compared to AD, suggesting that prolonged duration of diarrhea is accompanied by a depletion of healthy gut commensals.

This leaves a tremendous gap in translating microbiome science to personalized biomarkers and therapies. While multi-omic studies represent a promising means of prioritizing leads for validation, this still leaves thousands of molecular targets for most phenotypes of interest. The Human Microbiome Bioactives Resource (HMBR) provides a set of computational and experimental protocols for accelerating these tasks, including the identification of “bioactive” strains, microbial proteins, and chemical products from the human gut, as well as newly predicting function for uncharacterized genes and metabolites. These have proven effective in applications as diverse as the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD, in a meta-analysis spanning over 8,700 metagenomes) or companion animal nutrition (employing almost 2,500 canine and feline gut samples). In an end-to-end example linking metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metabolomics, inflammation phenotypes, and drug treatment, we have specifically identified a subset of microbial gene families responsible for 5-ASA inactivation, the leading cause of progression to second-line treatments in IBD.

The human body carries some four pounds of microbes, primarily in the gut, and understanding their biomolecular functions, their influences on human hosts, and the metabolic and functional roles of microbial communities generally is one of the key areas of study enabled by high-throughput sequencing. First, computational methods are needed to advance functional metagenomics. How can we understand what a microbial community is doing, what small molecule metabolites or signaling mechanisms it’s employing, and how its function relates to its organismal composition? Second, our understanding of the human microbiome and its relationship with public health remains limited.

Abstract of this talk: Most genetic material encountered in microbial communities - including the human microbiome - remains both uncharacterized and, often, strain-specific. This leaves a tremendous gap in translating microbiome science to personalized biomarkers and therapies. While multi-omic studies represent a promising means of prioritizing leads for validation, this still leaves thousands of molecular targets for most phenotypes of interest. The Human Microbiome Bioactives Resource (HMBR) provides a set of computational and experimental protocols for accelerating these tasks, including the identification of “bioactive” strains, microbial proteins, and chemical products from the human gut, as well as newly predicting function for uncharacterized genes and metabolites. These have proven effective in applications as diverse as the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD, in a meta-analysis spanning over 8,700 metagenomes) or companion animal nutrition (employing almost 2,500 canine and feline gut samples). In an end-to-end example linking metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metabolomics, inflammation phenotypes, and drug treatment, we have specifically identified a subset of microbial gene families responsible for 5-ASA inactivation, the leading cause of progression to second-line treatments in IBD. Together, this family of approaches provides multiple new avenues for identifying molecular activities responsible for microbiome-phenotype associations."

Previous studies identified that the gut microbiota of men who have sex with men (MSM) is distinct from that of non-MSM. Here, we reveal through species-level microbiota analysis using shotgun metagenomics that the gut microbiota of many MSM with Western origin resembles gut microbial communities of non-Westernized populations. Specifically, MSM gut microbiomes are frequently dominated by members of the Prevotellaceae family, including co-colonization of species from the Segatella copri complex and unknown Prevotellaceae members. Questionnaire-based analysis exploring inter-individual differences in MSM links specific sexual practices to microbiota composition. Moreover, machine learning identifies microbial features associated with sexual activities in MSM. Together, this study shows associations of sexual activities with gut microbiome alterations in MSM, which may have a large impact on population-based microbiota studies.

However, finding commonalities between different experiments, habitats, or conditions is very difficult due to technical issues related to using different primer pairs and relying on taxonomy for scientific reporting. Hence, grosso modo, the 16S rRNA microbiome literature has not been integrated into a collaborative body of knowledge. It often comprises effectively isolated studies, where researchers may be completely unaware of commonalities between their findings and those in other studies, especially across different niches or habitats. In the past five years, we have created dbBact (www.dbbact.org), a knowledge base, to bridge this gap and lay the groundwork for gaining core pan-microbiome insights. Briefly, amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) from datasets of published papers are manually analyzed, and bacterial sequences associated with experimental conditions are uploaded to dbBact, together with ontology-based characterizations (e.g., “the abundance of sequence ACTGGA… was higher in fecal samples of horses with colitis compared to healthy controls in California”). To date, dbBact contains data from more than 1000 published studies across diverse habitats, spanning ~370,000 unique 16S rRNA ASVs, with approximately 1,500,000 sequence-to-phenotype associations. We demonstrated how dbBact provides many types of novel hypotheses that cannot be formulated by standard methods (Amir et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 2023). We will show how dbBact may be (1) applied as part of microbiome research in any niche; (2) allow a new type of meta-analysis; and (3) be harnessed to answer ecological questions.

Gut microbiota may partially mediate this association and could be potential targets for intervention; however, its role is understudied. We included 1,592 infants from the Canadian Healthy Infants Longitudinal Development Cohort. Data on environmental exposure and lifestyle factors were collected prenatally and throughout the first three years. Weight outcomes were measured at one and three years of age. Stool samples collected at 3 and 12 months were analyzed by sequencing the V4 region of 16S rRNA to profile microbial compositions and magnetic resonance spectroscopy to quantify the metabolites. We showed that quitting smoking during pregnancy did not lower the risk of offspring being overweight. However, exclusive breastfeeding until the third month of age may alleviate these risks.

We further revealed that Firmicutes diversity mediates the elevated risk of childhood overweight and obesity linked to maternal prenatal smoking. This effect possibly occurs through excessive microbial butyrate production. These findings add to the evidence that women should quit smoking before their pregnancies to prevent microbiome-mediated childhood overweight and obesity risk, and indicate the potential obesogenic role of excessive butyrate production in early life.

By intensively engaging with communities that range from rural and horticultural to urban informal settlements and post-industrial, we capture population diversity that represents a far greater breadth of the world’s population.

We uncover a wealth of prokaryotic and viral novelty, including 1,005 new bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes, and identify phylogeography signatures in Treponema succinifaciens. Finally, we find a microbiome signature of HIV infection that is defined by several taxa not previously associated with HIV, including Dysosmobacter welbionis and Enterocloster sp.

Today, Isala has inspired more than ten projects in other countries, united under the mission to improve women's health through investigation of the vaginal microbiome. This talk presents Marie, the Swiss sister project, and the first official collaboration between projects from the Isala sisterhood: Laura, Leke, Marie, and Isala. This collaboration interlinks fundamental biomedical research with social sciences methodologies to generate research evidence on the impact of menstrual products on the vaginal microbiome, complemented with women’s views, perceptions, and concerns about menstrual health management. Hand in hand with international policymakers, local organizations and the private sector, the four sisters want to bring knowledge of the impact of menstrual products on the vaginal microbiome to the current agenda on menstrual health.

Ticlla Ccenhua,https://www.linkedin.com/in/monica-ticlla/?originalSubdomain=ch,"I am a bioinformatician with a background in molecular biology, and during my doctoral studies I specialised in metagenomics of human microbiomes; humans' microbial selves fascinate me. Improving healthcare for women and infants drives my current research interests. That is why I reoriented my career toward the study of the cervicovaginal microbiome. My main focus is to harness vaginal microbes' potential to design effective personalised therapies. I also want to break women’s health taboos by actively and effectively communicating scientific knowledge. My other interests and experiences are in graph-based integration of omic datasets, computational reproducibility, and more recently adopting human-centred design for developing bioinformatic tools for non-technical users.",Department of Bioscience Engineering,Postdoctoral Fellow,grid.441685.a,https://i.imgur.com/tgTHzk0.jpeg,"Full title of the presentation: ""The Marie Project: The Vaginal Microbiome & Menstrual Health in Switzerland and Beyond""
