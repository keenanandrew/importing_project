In particular, how is the microbiome structured from genes and molecular pathways to cells and microbial subcommunities? What are the steps regulating differentiation and signaling in the immune system? What are the mutational patterns and selective pressures that drive cancer evolution?

When chicks are raised by a maternal hen, they quickly develop a gastrointestinal microbiota that is similar to their mother. However, commercially-raised chicks have no direct contact with maternal hens or their faeces. They subsequently develop a less-diverse microbiota that is seeded from their environment. By delivering microbiota transplants from chickens with a desired phenotype to chicks raised without maternal contact we can define the trajectory of their microbiota development. This allows us to examine the impact of the transplanted microbiota on the development of desired phenotypes. However, studies have shown varying success when attempting to conduct microbiota transplants in chickens, potentially due to the variability of techniques used. We investigated whether it was possible to transplant the caecal microbiota between 40 week old adult chickens and freshly hatched chicks from a different chicken breed. Caecal contents were collected from the adult birds and within 30 minutes were administered orally to chicks. The microbiota of treated and control chicks was characterised via 16S rRNA gene sequencing at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 days post-hatch. At all timepoints, the microbiota of treated chicks was significantly different in composition and richer and more diverse than control birds. Transplantation clearly changed the trajectory of the treated birds so that they developed a microbiota which was far more similar to the donor birds than the control chicks. The most notable taxonomic difference between control and treated birds was the abundance of the phylum Bacteroidota. This phylum was present in high relative abundance in the donor samples (38%) and also in the treated samples (day 7: 41%). However, it was almost completely absent from the control birds (Day7: 0.02%).

However, the mechanisms and levels of donor strain engraftment required to elicit these effects remain poorly characterised. To address this, we performed a double-blinded randomised placebo-controlled trial for FMT in 87 adolescents with obesity. Participants were randomized to receive multi-donor FMT (capsules containing the fecal microbiota of four healthy, lean, sex-matched donors) or placebo (saline capsules). Following a bowel cleanse, participants ingested a total of 28 capsules over two consecutive days. FMT capsules and recipient stool samples collected at baseline, 6-, 12- and 26-weeks post-treatment were analysed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing allowing us to track donor strain engraftment and monitor changes in the recipient gut microbiome over time. We found that multi-donor FMT sustainably altered the structure and functional potential of the gut microbiome for up to six months.

Abstract: Transplantation of faecal microbiota (FMT) from healthy lean donors has been shown to transiently improve insulin sensitivity and alter fat distribution in individuals with obesity and metabolic syndrome. However, the mechanisms and levels of donor strain engraftment required to elicit these effects remain poorly characterised. To address this, we performed a double-blinded randomised placebo-controlled trial for FMT in 87 adolescents with obesity.  Participants were randomized to receive multi-donor FMT (capsules containing the fecal microbiota of four healthy, lean, sex-matched donors) or placebo (saline capsules). Following a bowel cleanse, participants ingested a total of 28 capsules over two consecutive days. FMT capsules and recipient stool samples collected at baseline, 6-, 12- and 26-weeks post-treatment were analysed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing allowing us to track donor strain engraftment and monitor changes in the recipient gut microbiome over time.   We found that multi-donor FMT sustainably altered the structure and functional potential of the gut microbiome for up to six months. In what was effectively a microbiome competition experiment, we discovered that two donor microbiomes (one female, one male) dominated strain engraftment. These ‘super-donor’ microbiomes were characterized by high microbial diversity and a high Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio. Engrafted strains led to enterotype-level shifts in community composition and provided genes that altered the metabolic potential of the microbiome, including pathways previously shown to be important in energy balance homeostasis (e.g. NAD biosynthesis). Despite our attempts to standardize FMT dose and donors, FMT recipients varied widely in their engraftment of donor strains suggesting the host environment plays a critical role in mediating FMT receptivity. Further work is required to better understand the various host-microbe interactions that determine engraftment success to help in developing more effective and personalised microbial therapies.

HGT plays a critical role in spreading of antibiotic resistance genes in bacteria.

Maternal high-fat (HF) diet has long-term deleterious effect on offspring’s metabolic phenotype. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether maternal metformin (MT) administration ameliorates the negative effects of maternal HF diet on offspring and the role of gut microbiota and microbial bile acids (BAs) in it. 
Methods:
After mating, the pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to HF diet (60% fat) or standard CHOW diet (11.8% fat) group, and some of the HF diet group rats were co-treated with MT via drinking water (300 mg/kg/day), resulting in three groups according to maternal diet and MT treatment during gestation and lactation. All offspring were weaned on CHOW diet. The intestinal tissues and colon content of offspring rats were collected. In addition, offspring’s hypothalamus gene expression and BA content in plasma of adult male offspring was analyzed. 
Results:
Maternal HF diet resulted in increased body weight and adipose depots, increased intestinal and hypothalamic inflammation, changed gene expression of intestinal tight junctions and hypothalamic appetite markers in both male and female offspring at weaning, which continued into adulthood. The effects of maternal HF diet on offspring were alleviated by maternal MT administration. Interestingly, offspring’s microbiota composition in adulthood was profoundly influenced by maternal HF diet and MT administration. Furthermore, the plasma BA content was normalized by maternal MT administration in adult male offspring of HF-fed dams, and maternal MT administration significantly enriched the proportion of the beneficial Lactobacillus genera, which were negatively correlated with plasma unconjugated BA levels. 
Conclusions:
This study demonstrated the beneficial effects of maternal MT administration on offspring’s metabolic phenotype, focusing on the microbiota-BA-hypothalamus axis. The present study indicates that maternal MT administration could reshape the gut microbiota in adult offspring, normalize offspring’s plasma BA levels and gene expression of hypothalamic appetite markers, which may contribute to the beneficial effects of maternal MT exposure on offspring’s metabolic phenotype.",unknown,unknown,unknown,lsong1030@xjtu.edu.cn,Dr.,Lin Song,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lin-Song-17,unknown,Department of Physiology,unknown,grid.43169.39,unknown,"Title of the presentation: ""Maternal metformin treatment persistently ameliorates high-fat diet-induced metabolic symptoms and modulates gut microbiota in rat offspring""

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether maternal metformin (MT) administration ameliorates the negative effects of maternal HF diet on offspring and the role of gut microbiota and microbial bile acids (BAs) in it.   
Methods:
After mating, the pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to HF diet (60% fat) or standard CHOW diet (11.8% fat) group, and some of the HF diet group rats were co-treated with MT via drinking water (300 mg/kg/day), resulting in three groups according to maternal diet and MT treatment during gestation and lactation. All offspring were weaned on CHOW diet. The intestinal tissues and colon content of offspring rats were collected. In addition, offspring’s hypothalamus gene expression and BA content in plasma of adult male offspring was analyzed.     
Results:
Maternal HF diet resulted in increased body weight and adipose depots, increased intestinal and hypothalamic inflammation, changed gene expression of intestinal tight junctions and hypothalamic appetite markers in both male and female offspring at weaning, which continued into adulthood. The effects of maternal HF diet on offspring were alleviated by maternal MT administration. Interestingly, offspring’s microbiota composition in adulthood was profoundly influenced by maternal HF diet and MT administration. Furthermore, the plasma BA content was normalized by maternal MT administration in adult male offspring of HF-fed dams, and maternal MT administration significantly enriched the proportion of the beneficial Lactobacillus genera, which were negatively correlated with plasma unconjugated BA levels.   
Conclusions:
This study demonstrated the beneficial effects of maternal MT administration on offspring’s metabolic phenotype, focusing on the microbiota-BA-hypothalamus axis. The present study indicates that maternal MT administration could reshape the gut microbiota in adult offspring, normalize offspring’s plasma BA levels and gene expression of hypothalamic appetite markers, which may contribute to the beneficial effects of maternal MT exposure on offspring’s metabolic phenotype."

Despite being the third-largest solid component in breastmilk, HMOs are indigestible by infants, and they serve as food for the infant gut bacteria. Most research thus far has focused on Bifidobacterium species that harbor many glycoside hydrolases (GHs) tailored to break the carbon bonds in HMO molecules. However, there are additional microbes in the infant gut, such as Bacteroides species, with increasing evidence that they, too, are able to break-down HMOs. To study the unbiased impact of breastfeeding on the infant gut microbiome, we need to investigate the underlying mechanisms of HMO utilization by all members of the infant gut. Here, we developed an optimized system for isolating Bacteroides strains from infant stool samples. We then examined the HMO utilization capacity of multiple Bacteroides isolates by performing growth curves on six common HMOs (2’-FL, DFL, 3’-SL, 6’-SL, LNT, LNnT).

We showed that B. dorei employs an extensive metabolic response to HMOs. Surprisingly, there was no clear up-regulation for most GH families previously known to break-down HMOs, possibly because they were almost exclusively described in Bifidobacterium species. Instead, B. dorei exhibits a generalized response to HMOs, markedly up-regulating several shared GH families across all conditions.
