Although previous research has demonstrated that pathogenic organisms may translocate from the gut microbiome into the bloodstream to cause infections, the mechanisms by which HCT patients acquire pathogens in their microbiome have not yet been described. We hypothesized that patient-patient transmission may be responsible for pathogens colonizing the microbiome of HCT patients, and that patients who share time and space in the hospital are more likely to share bacterial strains.
 
Here, we used linked-read and short-read metagenomic sequencing to analyze 401 stool samples collected from 149 adults undergoing HCT and hospitalized in the same unit over a period of three years. We used metagenomic assembly and strain-specific comparison methods to investigate transmission of gut microbiota between individuals. While transmission of pathogens was found to be rare, we did observe four pairs of patients who harbor identical or nearly identical E. faecium strains in their microbiome. These strains may be the result of transmission between patients who shared a room and bathroom, acquisition from a common source in the hospital or transmission from an unsampled source.
 
We also observed identical Akkermansia muciniphila and Hungatella hathewayi strains in two pairs of patients. In both cases, the patients were roommates for at least one day, the strain was absent in the putative recipient’s microbiome prior to the period of roommate overlap and the putative recipient had a microbiome perturbed by antibiotic treatment for a bloodstream infection. Finally, we identified multiple patients who acquired identical strains of several species commonly found in commercial probiotics and dairy products, including Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus gasseri and Streptococcus thermophilus. Overall, the limited amount of putative transmission observed indicates that current infection control and contact precautions are successful in preventing interpersonal exchange of microbes. However, the potential transmission of commensal microbes with immunomodulatory properties raises interesting questions about the recovery of microbiome diversity after HCT, and indicates that patients in this setting may acquire new microbes by sharing space with others.",,,,bsiranos@stanford.edu,Dr.,Benjamin Siranosian,https://www.bsiranosian.com/,"I'm Ben, a computational biologist, genomic detective, and entrepreneur.

Surprisingly, the bottom site of the Challenger Deep was found to still harbor 20 subtypes of known ARGs. Both the abundance (1.08 to 1.12×10-1 GP16S each) and diversity (127 to 153 subtypes) of the hadal seawater ARGs (Fig. 2b) were surprisingly high in the hadal seawater of the Mariana trench. The abundance of ARGs in seawater is higher than that in sediments by up to two orders of magnitude, deterministic natural processes drivers the resistome differences between hadal sediment and seawater including habitat (environmental) filtering and biotic interactions (e.g., competition). iii) HGT mediated by phage and integrase as the major mechanism for the evolution of Mariana Trench sediment bacteria (Fig. 3a); iv) substantial co-selection of virulence genes and ARGs in taxonomically diverse bacteria in the hadal sediment, especially for the Challenger Deep bottom where mobilized ARGs and virulence genes are favorably enriched in largely unexplored bacteria (Fig. 4)."

This work underscores the critical need to broaden the scope of human gut microbiome research and include understudied, nonwestern populations to improve the relevance and accuracy of microbiome discoveries to broader populations."

In addition to normal microbiota, pathogens like carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae may be asymptomatically present. When these bacteria are present at very low levels, they are often undetectable in hospital surveillance cultures, known as occult or subclinical colonization. Through the use of antibiotics, these subclinical pathogens can increase to sufficiently high levels to become detectable, in a process called outgrowth. However, little is known about the interaction between gut microbiota and Enterobacteriaceae during occult colonization and outgrowth. Results: We developed a clinically-relevant mouse model for studying occult colonization. Conventional wild-type mice without antibiotic pre-treatment were exposed to K. pneumoniae but rapidly tested negative for colonization. This occult colonization was found to perturb the microbiome as detected by both 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Outgrowth of occult K. pneumoniae was induced either by a four-antibiotic cocktail or by individual receipt of ampicillin, vancomycin or azithromycin, which all reduced overall microbial diversity. Notably, vancomycin was shown to trigger K. pneumoniae outgrowth in only a subset of exposed animals (outgrowth-susceptible). To identify factors that underlie outgrowth susceptibility, we analyzed microbiome-encoded gene functions and were able to classify outgrowth-susceptible microbiomes using pathways associated with mRNA stability. Lastly, an evolutionary approach illuminated the importance of xylose metabolism in K. pneumoniae colonization, supporting xylose abundance as a second susceptibility indicator. We showed that our model is generalizable to other pathogens, including carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Conclusions: Our modeling of occult colonization and outgrowth could help the development of strategies to mitigate the risk of subsequent infection and transmission in medical facilities and the wider community. This study suggests that microbiota mRNA and small-molecule metabolites may be used to predict outgrowth-susceptibility.

Instead, our data support a model whereby ASD-related restricted interests are associated with less-diverse diet, and in turn reduced microbial taxonomic diversity and looser stool consistency.

Abstract of this talk: There is increasing interest in the potential contribution of the gut microbiome to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, previous studies have been underpowered and have not been designed to address potential confounding factors in a comprehensive way. We performed a large autism stool metagenomics study (n = 247) based on participants from the Australian Autism Biobank and the Queensland Twin Adolescent Brain project. We found negligible direct associations between ASD diagnosis and the gut microbiome. Instead, our data support a model whereby ASD-related restricted interests are associated with less-diverse diet, and in turn reduced microbial taxonomic diversity and looser stool consistency. In contrast to ASD diagnosis, our dataset was well powered to detect microbiome associations with traits such as age, dietary intake, and stool consistency. Overall, microbiome differences in ASD may reflect dietary preferences that relate to diagnostic features, and we caution against claims that the microbiome has a driving role in ASD."

In particular, how is the microbiome structured from genes and molecular pathways to cells and microbial subcommunities? What are the steps regulating differentiation and signaling in the immune system? What are the mutational patterns and selective pressures that drive cancer evolution?

However, many available tools to process this data require both bioinformatics skills and high computational power to process big datasets. Furthermore, there are only few tools that allow for long read amplicon data analysis. To bridge this gap, we developed the LotuS2 (Less OTU Scripts 2) pipeline, enabling user-friendly, resource friendly, and versatile analysis of raw amplicon sequences. In LotuS2, six different sequence clustering algorithms as well as extensive pre- and post-processing options allow for flexible data analysis by both experts, where parameters can be fully adjusted, and novices, where defaults are provided for different scenarios. We benchmarked three independent gut and soil datasets, where LotuS2 was on average 29 times faster compared to other pipelines – yet could better reproduce the alpha- and beta-diversity of technical replicate samples. Further benchmarking a mock community with known taxa composition showed that, compared to the other pipelines, LotuS2 recovered a higher fraction of correctly identified genera and species (98% and 57%, respectively). At ASV/OTU level, precision and F-score were highest for LotuS2, as was the fraction of correctly reconstructed 16S sequences.

Abstract of this talk: Amplicon sequencing is an established and cost-efficient method for profiling microbiomes. However, many available tools to process this data require both bioinformatics skills and high computational power to process big datasets. Furthermore, there are only few tools that allow for long read amplicon data analysis. To bridge this gap, we developed the LotuS2 (Less OTU Scripts 2) pipeline, enabling user-friendly, resource friendly, and versatile analysis of raw amplicon sequences.  In LotuS2, six different sequence clustering algorithms as well as extensive pre- and post-processing options allow for flexible data analysis by both experts, where parameters can be fully adjusted, and novices, where defaults are provided for different scenarios.  We benchmarked three independent gut and soil datasets, where LotuS2 was on average 29 times faster compared to other pipelines – yet could better reproduce the alpha- and beta-diversity of technical replicate samples. Further benchmarking a mock community with known taxa composition showed that, compared to the other pipelines, LotuS2 recovered a higher fraction of correctly identified genera and species (98% and 57%, respectively). At ASV/OTU level, precision and F-score were highest for LotuS2, as was the fraction of correctly reconstructed 16S sequences. In conclusion, LotuS2 is a lightweight and user-friendly pipeline that is fast, precise and streamlined. High data usage rates and reliability enable high-throughput microbiome analysis in minutes."

When chicks are raised by a maternal hen, they quickly develop a gastrointestinal microbiota that is similar to their mother. However, commercially-raised chicks have no direct contact with maternal hens or their faeces. They subsequently develop a less-diverse microbiota that is seeded from their environment. By delivering microbiota transplants from chickens with a desired phenotype to chicks raised without maternal contact we can define the trajectory of their microbiota development. This allows us to examine the impact of the transplanted microbiota on the development of desired phenotypes. However, studies have shown varying success when attempting to conduct microbiota transplants in chickens, potentially due to the variability of techniques used. We investigated whether it was possible to transplant the caecal microbiota between 40 week old adult chickens and freshly hatched chicks from a different chicken breed. Caecal contents were collected from the adult birds and within 30 minutes were administered orally to chicks. The microbiota of treated and control chicks was characterised via 16S rRNA gene sequencing at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 days post-hatch. At all timepoints, the microbiota of treated chicks was significantly different in composition and richer and more diverse than control birds. Transplantation clearly changed the trajectory of the treated birds so that they developed a microbiota which was far more similar to the donor birds than the control chicks. The most notable taxonomic difference between control and treated birds was the abundance of the phylum Bacteroidota. This phylum was present in high relative abundance in the donor samples (38%) and also in the treated samples (day 7: 41%). However, it was almost completely absent from the control birds (Day7: 0.02%).

Another consequence of such studies is an exponential increase in the number of uncharacterized and understudied microbes identified as potential drivers of mucosal health and disease. Thus, there is an impending challenge looming on the horizon to reveal the molecular basis for these observations. To meet this challenge, many newly identified microbes will require the development of new genetic systems useful for interrogating experimental models. Our laboratory has devoted a significant effort to improve the genetic tractability of a variety of important understudied microbiome species, especially those that have been traditionally considered as “genetically intractable”. Here, we will discuss a recently developed genetic system for one such pathobiont species, Parvimonas micra. Our preferred approach to develop new genetic systems begins with identifying and exploiting endogenous natural competence abilities (i.e. energy-dependent exogenous DNA uptake). Accordingly, we identified a natural competence ability in P. micra, which allowed us to employ cloning-independent methodologies to construct a variety of targeted genetic mutations directly within low-passage clinical isolates.

Currently, few efficacious treatment options are available to mitigate the many types of chronic diseases triggered by mucosal dysbiosis, such as oral diseases, irritable bowel disease, urogenital tract infections, chronic lung infections, etc. Mucosal dysbiosis is also increasingly associated with the development of a variety of different cancers, with many tumors being stably colonized by various microbiome species. The treatment of dysbiotic diseases poses a unique challenge because the few microbiome species associated with pathology naturally live amongst a plethora of other beneficial microbes within mixed communities. Ultimately, effective therapeutic solutions will require a much deeper understanding of microbiome ecology and its impact upon the host response. Projects in the Merritt Lab encompass a wide range of topics including clinical microbiology, bacterial genetics, protein biochemistry/structure, and infection biology.

Abstract of this talk: With the recent explosion of next-generation sequencing and OMICS studies of human microbiome communities, a surprisingly broad diversity of diseases have been found to correlate with mucosal dysbiosis. Another consequence of such studies is an exponential increase in the number of uncharacterized and understudied microbes identified as potential drivers of mucosal health and disease. Thus, there is an impending challenge looming on the horizon to reveal the molecular basis for these observations. To meet this challenge, many newly identified microbes will require the development of new genetic systems useful for interrogating experimental models. Our laboratory has devoted a significant effort to improve the genetic tractability of a variety of important understudied microbiome species, especially those that have been traditionally considered as “genetically intractable”. Here, we will discuss a recently developed genetic system for one such pathobiont species, Parvimonas micra. Our preferred approach to develop new genetic systems begins with identifying and exploiting endogenous natural competence abilities (i.e. energy-dependent exogenous DNA uptake). Accordingly, we identified a natural competence ability in P. micra, which allowed us to employ cloning-independent methodologies to construct a variety of targeted genetic mutations directly within low-passage clinical isolates. In addition, we successfully developed a luciferase-based reporter system, a theophylline-inducible gene expression system, and a Mariner transposon mutagenesis system for Tn-seq studies of P. micra.

HGT plays a critical role in spreading of antibiotic resistance genes in bacteria. Currently no solution exists to reverse the antibiotic resistance or prevent it from further spreading via HGT apart from the conservative approach of antibiotics stewardship, that has so far showed limited success in eliminating the resistant strains. Therefore, we study mechanism and regulation of HGT in human pathogenic and commensal bacteria with a far-reaching goal of countering antibiotic resistance spread by modulating DNA exchange.

Maternal high-fat (HF) diet has long-term deleterious effect on offspring’s metabolic phenotype. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether maternal metformin (MT) administration ameliorates the negative effects of maternal HF diet on offspring and the role of gut microbiota and microbial bile acids (BAs) in it. 
Methods:
After mating, the pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to HF diet (60% fat) or standard CHOW diet (11.8% fat) group, and some of the HF diet group rats were co-treated with MT via drinking water (300 mg/kg/day), resulting in three groups according to maternal diet and MT treatment during gestation and lactation. All offspring were weaned on CHOW diet. The intestinal tissues and colon content of offspring rats were collected. In addition, offspring’s hypothalamus gene expression and BA content in plasma of adult male offspring was analyzed. 
Results:
Maternal HF diet resulted in increased body weight and adipose depots, increased intestinal and hypothalamic inflammation, changed gene expression of intestinal tight junctions and hypothalamic appetite markers in both male and female offspring at weaning, which continued into adulthood. The effects of maternal HF diet on offspring were alleviated by maternal MT administration.

Conclusions:
This study demonstrated the beneficial effects of maternal MT administration on offspring’s metabolic phenotype, focusing on the microbiota-BA-hypothalamus axis.

Despite these efforts, sustainability and reproducibility are major issues since continued validation through software testing is still not a widely adopted practice. In the field of microbial bioinformatics, good software engineering practices are not yet widely adopted. Many microbial bioinformaticians start out as (micro)biologists and subsequently learn how to code. Without abundant formal training, a lot of education about good software engineering practices comes down to an exchange of information within the microbial bioinformatics community. Here, we report seven recommendations that help researchers implement software testing in microbial bioinformatics. These recommendations are: Establish software needs and testing goals; Use appropriate input test files; Use an easy-to-follow language format to implement testing; Try to automate testing; Test across multiple computational setups; and Encourage others to test your software. We propose collaborative software testing as an opportunity to continuously engage software users, developers, and students to unify scientific work across domains. As automated software testing remains underused in scientific software, our set of recommendations not only ensures appropriate effort can be invested into producing high quality and robust software but also increases engagement in its sustainability. We have developed these recommendations based on our experience from a collaborative hackathon organised prior to the American Society for Microbiology Next Generation Sequencing (ASM NGS) 2020 conference.

Despite these efforts, sustainability and reproducibility are major issues since continued validation through software testing is still not a widely adopted practice.    In the field of microbial bioinformatics, good software engineering practices are not yet widely adopted. Many microbial bioinformaticians start out as (micro)biologists and subsequently learn how to code. Without abundant formal training, a lot of education about good software engineering practices comes down to an exchange of information within the microbial bioinformatics community.   Here, we report seven recommendations that help researchers implement software testing in microbial bioinformatics. These recommendations are: Establish software needs and testing goals;  Use appropriate input test files; Use an easy-to-follow language format to implement testing; Try to automate testing; Test across multiple computational setups; and Encourage others to test your software.  We propose collaborative software testing as an opportunity to continuously engage software users, developers, and students to unify scientific work across domains. As automated software testing remains underused in scientific software, our set of recommendations not only ensures appropriate effort can be invested into producing high quality and robust software but also increases engagement in its sustainability.  We have developed these recommendations based on our experience from a collaborative hackathon organised prior to the American Society for Microbiology Next Generation Sequencing (ASM NGS) 2020 conference. We also present a repository hosting examples and guidelines for testing, available from https://github.com/microbinfie-hackathon2020/CSIS.

Despite being the third-largest solid component in breastmilk, HMOs are indigestible by infants, and they serve as food for the infant gut bacteria. Most research thus far has focused on Bifidobacterium species that harbor many glycoside hydrolases (GHs) tailored to break the carbon bonds in HMO molecules. However, there are additional microbes in the infant gut, such as Bacteroides species, with increasing evidence that they, too, are able to break-down HMOs. To study the unbiased impact of breastfeeding on the infant gut microbiome, we need to investigate the underlying mechanisms of HMO utilization by all members of the infant gut. Here, we developed an optimized system for isolating Bacteroides strains from infant stool samples. We then examined the HMO utilization capacity of multiple Bacteroides isolates by performing growth curves on six common HMOs (2’-FL, DFL, 3’-SL, 6’-SL, LNT, LNnT).

We identified variation in HMO utilization across multiple strains of the same species, and chose to focus here on a Bacteroides dorei isolate that was able to utilize the test HMOs. We performed RNA sequencing on B. dorei cultures, comparing the transcriptional profile in minimal media supplemented with glucose or HMOs. We showed that B. dorei employs an extensive metabolic response to HMOs. Surprisingly, there was no clear up-regulation for most GH families previously known to break-down HMOs, possibly because they were almost exclusively described in Bifidobacterium species. Instead, B. dorei exhibits a generalized response to HMOs, markedly up-regulating several shared GH families across all conditions. Within each GH family, B. dorei displays a consistent pattern of up-regulation of some genes with down-regulation of the others. This response pattern to HMOs has yet to be described in other commensals of the infant gut.

Also, markers of intestinal damage or systemic inflammation were not affected. No substantial effects on the gut microbiota composition were observed.

Apart from effects on brain function, also psychological symptoms, such as depression symptoms and sleep patterns, were slightly affected, even if none of the subjects experienced mental dysfunction at baseline. Other ratings, such as anxiety, perceived health, quality of life and perceived workload were not affected. Similarly, the probiotic intervention did not affect perceived stress nor the cortisol awakening response in non-evoked situations. In terms of signalling molecules, serotonin showed slightly higher baseline-corrected serum concentrations after probiotics compared to placebo, while brain-derived neurotrophic factor concentrations were not affected. Also, markers of intestinal damage or systemic inflammation were not affected. No substantial effects on the gut microbiota composition were observed. The probiotic intervention evoked distinct changes in brain function and subtle changes in psychological symptoms even in a healthy study population. These results give promising hints that patients with a disturbed gut-brain axis function could benefit from probiotic intake."

Here we examined the gut microbiotas of 57 takahē at eight separate locations across Aotearoa New Zealand. Faecal samples, taken as a proxy for the hindgut bacterial community, were subjected to 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing using Illumina MiSeq. Phylogenetic analysis of more than 2200 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) revealed nine main bacterial phyla (Acidobacteriota, Actinobacteriota, Bacteroidota, Campilobacterota, Firmicutes, Fusobacteriota, Planctomycetota, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobiota) that accounted for the majority of sequence reads.

There was strong evidence (p = 0.002) for a difference in the abundance of the genus Lactobacillus between locations. A common commensal bacterium previously described in takahē, Campylobacter spp., was also detected in most faecal samples. Location plays a pivotal role in the observed variation among takahē gut bacterial communities and is potentially due to factors such as supplemental feeding and medical treatment experienced by birds housed in captivity at one of the eight sampled sites.

This is especially true since the decrease of sequencing cost has led to an explosion of the number of genomes in public repositories. Estimating the amount of contamination, i.e. the inclusion of unwanted DNA in genomic materials, of this deluge of data has become a field in itself, with numerous algorithms now available and an increasing rate of publication over the years. As newly released tools do not simply replace older ones, but have their own scope, it becomes difficult for scientists to efficiently determine which tool to use in their study. Recently, we have published an overview of the main characteristics and applicability of 18 algorithms dedicated to the estimation of genomic contamination. For instance, the conceptual differences between database-free tools and those associated with a reference database have an effect on detection sensitivity, as do the difference between genomewide and marker-based methods. Beyond this typology of tools, we present here a new analysis designed to compare algorithms on a large simulated dataset derived from empirical data.

Abstract of this talk: Nowadays, genomes constitute the basis of many research endeavors. This is especially true since the decrease of sequencing cost has led to an explosion of the number of genomes in public repositories. Estimating the amount of contamination, i.e. the inclusion of unwanted DNA in genomic materials, of this deluge of data has become a field in itself, with numerous algorithms now available and an increasing rate of publication over the years. As newly released tools do not simply replace older ones, but have their own scope, it becomes difficult for scientists to efficiently determine which tool to use in their study. Recently, we have published an overview of the main characteristics and applicability of 18 algorithms dedicated to the estimation of genomic contamination. For instance, the conceptual differences between database-free tools and those associated with a reference database have an effect on detection sensitivity, as do the difference between genomewide and marker-based methods. Beyond this typology of tools, we present here a new analysis designed to compare algorithms on a large simulated dataset derived from empirical data. This protocol, dubbed CRACOT for CRitical Assessment of COntamination detection at  multiple Taxonomic levels, reveals both under- and over-detection by even the most commonly used algorithms, with simulated contamination events ranging from inter-phylum to inter-species."

It is estimated that up to 95% of the lung virome remains uncharacterised. Here, we aim to catalogue the virome associated with the human respiratory tract by reanalysing publicly available data using a newly-developed pipEline for Viral assEmbly and chaRactEriSaTion (EVEREST). Methods: Lung virome studies (n=85) utilising shotgun metagenomics and lung-attributed samples were gathered from public databases. Following manual curation (n=44), bioproject data was inputted into EVEREST (https://agudeloromero.github.io/EVEREST/), resulting in viral discovery and taxonomic classification of known and unknown viruses. Complete and high-quality contigs were further assessed for genomic characterisation. Results: From a singular bioproject (PRJEB32062), 182 viral contigs were captured and 14 were classified as complete/high-quality. Those contigs lengths ranged between 12-387 kilobases. Focusing on three of the complete/high-quality contigs, we discovered two novel prophages (Caudovirales), and a new bacteriophage (Siphoviridae). Additionally, putative protein coding sequence regions were scanned, which ranged between 50-67 proteins. Annotation analysis showed phage-associated proteins, including proteases, DNA binding proteins and tail sheath and tube proteins, among others. Conclusion: We identified known and novel viruses utilising publicly available lung metagenome studies.

Huang,https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=yyh,"Bacteria and bacterial viruses (phages) are the most abundant members of the gut microbiota and are important drivers of human health. Despite the large amounts of sequencing and -omics data available on the human gut microbiome, it remains challenging to identify the molecular mechanism underlying associations between specific microbes and disease states. A major barrier in the field is our inability to readily infer function from sequencing data since microbes are extremely diverse with poorly annotated genomes. Furthermore, predicting gene functions often requires mechanistic knowledge of the protein family and phenotypic data, which can be difficult to obtain. To address these challenges, the Huang lab uses multidisciplinary approaches including functional genomics, genetics, biochemistry, and bioinformatics to study new pathways encoded in gut bacteria and phages. We developed a high-throughput functional genomics platform, Barcoded Overexpression BActerial Shotgun Library Sequencing (Boba-seq), to interrogate gene functions at scale in a prominent group of gut anaerobes, Bacteroidales. These bacteria are highly abundant in the gut and are mostly associated with health due to their diverse repertoires of metabolic pathways and ability to access host-recalcitrant polysaccharides. DNA barcoding reduces the cost and increases the throughput of genome-wide genetic screens drastically. A major focus of the lab is to elucidate new roles and functions of genes important for nutrient acquisition and stress tolerance. We are also interested in identifying factors involved in bacteria-phage interactions. Phages are important members of the gut microbiota, but how they influence bacterial physiology and composition remains poorly understood. The overarching goal in the lab is to advance our fundamental knowledge of molecular mechanisms underlying host-microbe-phage interactions. This will help us to better understand and predict the composition and functions of microbial communities under constant selections from microbial, host, and environmental factors.",Department of Microbiology and Immunology,Assistant Professor,grid.273335.3,https://i.imgur.com/jlnqjDg.jpeg,"Title of the presentation: ""Functional screens of barcoded expression libraries uncover new gene functions in carbon utilization among gut Bacteroidales""

The urogenital microbiome is a key component of the urinary environment. However, changes in the urogenital microbiome underlying rUTI susceptibility are unknown. Here, we perform shotgun metagenomics and advanced culture on urine from a controlled cohort of postmenopausal women to identify urogenital microbiome compositional and function changes linked to rUTI susceptibility. We identify candidate taxonomic biomarkers of rUTI susceptibility in postmenopausal women and an enrichment of lactobacilli in postmenopausal women taking estrogen hormone therapy. We find robust correlations between Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and urinary estrogens in women without urinary tract infection (UTI) history. Functional analyses reveal distinct metabolic and antimicrobial resistance gene (ARG) signatures associated with rUTI. Importantly, we find that ARGs are enriched in the urogenital microbiomes of women with rUTI history independent of current UTI status. Our data suggest that rUTI and estrogen shape the urogenital microbiome in postmenopausal women.

We identify candidate taxonomic biomarkers of rUTI susceptibility in postmenopausal women and an enrichment of lactobacilli in postmenopausal women taking estrogen hormone therapy. We find robust correlations between Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and urinary estrogens in women without urinary tract infection (UTI) history. Functional analyses reveal distinct metabolic and antimicrobial resistance gene (ARG) signatures associated with rUTI. Importantly, we find that ARGs are enriched in the urogenital microbiomes of women with rUTI history independent of current UTI status. Our data suggest that rUTI and estrogen shape the urogenital microbiome in postmenopausal women.

Intratumoral host–microbiota studies have so far largely relied on bulk tissue analysis, which obscures the spatial distribution and localized effect of the microbiota within tumours. Here, by applying in situ spatial-profiling technologies and single-cell RNA sequencing to oral squamous cell carcinoma and colorectal cancer, we reveal spatial, cellular and molecular host–microbe interactions. We adapted 10x Visium spatial transcriptomics to determine the identity and in situ location of intratumoral microbial communities within patient tissues. Using GeoMx digital spatial profiling, we show that bacterial communities populate microniches that are less vascularized, highly immuno suppressive and associated with malignant cells with lower levels of Ki-67 as compared to bacteria-negative tumour regions. We developed a single-cell RNA-sequencing method that we name INVADEseq (invasion–adhesion-directed expression sequencing) and, by applying this to patient tumours, identify cell-associated bacteria and the host cells with which they interact, as well as uncovering alterations in transcriptional pathways that are involved in inflammation, metastasis, cell dormancy and DNA repair. Through functional studies, we show that cancer cells that are infected with bacteria invade their surrounding environment as single cells and recruit myeloid cells to bacterial regions. Collectively, our data reveal that the distribution of the microbiota within a tumour is not random; instead, it is highly organized in microniches with immune and epithelial cell functions that promote cancer progression.

To address this need, we developed mEnrich-seq, a method that can enrich taxa of interest from metagenomic DNA before sequencing. The core idea is to exploit the self vs. non-self genome differentiation provided by natural bacterial DNA methylation and rationally choose methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes (REs), individually or in combination, to deplete host DNA and most background microbial DNA while enriching bacterial taxa of interest. This core idea is integrated with library preparation procedures in a way that only non-digested DNA libraries are sequenced.

To achieve this, we grew natural microbial biofilms on glass slides in rivers for one month. The biofilms were then transferred to laboratory, recirculating flume systems and exposed to a single pulse of a model resistant invader bacterium (E. coli) either in presence or absence of stress induced by Cu2+. The invasion dynamics of E. coli into the biofilms were then monitored for 14 days. Despite an initially successful introduction of E. coli into the biofilms, independent of the imposed stress, over time the invader perished in absence of stress. However, under stress the invading strain successfully established and proliferated in the biofilms. Noteworthy, the increased establishment success of the invader coincided with a loss in microbial community diversity under stress conditions, likely due to additional niche space becoming available for the invader.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that the intrinsic resilience of the river microbiome towards invasion by ARB is strongly linked with maintaining diversity and that co-exposure to stressors that disrupt community diversity and structure increases long-term invasion success.

Abstract of this talk: The release of wastewater treatment plant effluents into rivers exposes the river microbiome to a high load of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) along with complex mixtures of abiotic pollutants acting as stressors. 
To understand the proliferation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) it is crucial to determine the factors that govern invasion of ARB into the river microbiome. Consequently, we here aim at elucidating how the resilience of the resident microbial communities against invasion by foreign ARB is affected by co-released stressors.

In this study, untreated wastewater was sampled from Hospital A designated to treat COVID-19 patients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic alongside Hospital B that did not receive any COVID-19 patients. Metagenomics was used to determine the relative abundance and mobile potential of antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs), prior to determining the correlation of ARGs with time/incidence of COVID-19. Our findings showed that ARGs resistant to macrolides, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines were positively correlated with time in Hospital A but not in Hospital B. Likewise, minor extended spectrum betalactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemases of classes B and D were positively correlated with time, suggesting the selection of rare and/or carbapenem-resistant genes in Hospital A.

Yet, evidence linking microbiome-dependent energy harvest to particular human gut microbiome compositions have been lacking. In this recently published study, we investigated whether energy extraction from the diet in 85 overweight adults, estimated by dry stool energy density, was associated with intestinal transit time and variations in microbial community diversity and structure. We found opposite of what we expected that stool energy density was positively associated with intestinal transit time. Furthermore, individuals with a Bacteroides enterotype (B-type) had significantly lower energy left in faeces (per gram dried faeces) compared to individuals with a Ruminococcaecea enterotype (R-type). The B-type individuals had lower alpha-diversity and faster intestinal transit time, but also a significantly higher body weight compared to the R-type individuals. Furthermore, markers of proteolytic fermentation were increased in the R-type compared to the B-type. Together, this could suggest that human gut microbiome-dependent energy extraction is diversified according to intestinal transit time and gut microbiome ecosystem variations as reflected by enterotypes. While the causalities remain to be established, the observations are intriguing and could provide new dietary strategies in body weight management.

Here, we applied a comprehensive comparative genomics approach to identify high-quality novel protein families exclusive from uncultivated species, and characterized them from a functional, ecological and evolutionary point of view. For such a purpose, we computed protein families from a large multi-habitat metagenomic dataset covering 400M genes from 170k genomes spanning the prokaryotic phylogeny. We then applied strict quality and novelty filters to avoid incomplete genes, assembling artifacts, distant homologs and potential pseudogenes. This led us to uncovering 400K high-quality gene families exclusive from uncultivated taxa, twice the number of gene families in reference databases like EggNOG. These high-quality novel gene families are widespread within and across habitats, indicating their ecological value. They also spread out across the microbial phylogeny and are notably overrepresented in recently discovered taxa. Most remarkably, we found that 980 previously neglected protein families can accurately distinguish entire uncultivated phyla, classes and orders, likely representing synapomorphic traits. We inferred the putative functional roles of the high-quality novel gene families by reconstructing their genomic neighborhood and estimating their degree of functional context conservation. 18% of the novel protein families are present in phylogenetically conserved operon regions, in some cases involving key metabolic genes, suggesting they may take part in central microbial processes. In order to facilitate the characterization of novel gene families in relevant genomic contexts, we developed http://novelgenefamilies.compgenomics.org, which allows to browse and visualize the genomic neighbors of any of our novel gene family predictions.

Neither infant exposure to oral antifungals nor maternal exposure to antibiotics during pregnancy were associated with infant microbiota composition. Four distinct groups of breast milk HMO compositions were evident, corresponding to maternal Secretor status and Lewis group combinations defined by the presence/absence of certain fucosylated HMOs. However, we found the strongest evidence for microbiota associations between two non-fucosylated HMOs: 6’-sialyllactose (6’-SL) and lacto-N-hexaose (LNH), which were associated with lower and higher relative abundances of Bifidobacterium, respectively. Among 111 exclusively formula-fed infants, the GOS-supplemented formula was associated with a lower relative abundance of Clostridium perfringens. In conclusion, the gut microbiota is sensitive to some prebiotic and antibiotic exposures during early infancy and understanding their effects could inform future strategies for safeguarding a health-promoting infant gut microbiota.

Among 111 exclusively formula-fed infants, the GOS-supplemented formula was associated with a lower relative abundance of Clostridium perfringens. In conclusion, the gut microbiota is sensitive to some prebiotic and antibiotic exposures during early infancy and understanding their effects could inform future strategies for safeguarding a health-promoting infant gut microbiota.

Assembly of the human gut microbiome during early life is a complex and dynamic process. Aberrations to the early gut microbiome have been repeatedly associated with later-life disease. While previous studies have explored the temporal development of the infant gut microbiome, none have done so in an exclusively breastfed population, nor in an Australian context. Here, we characterized the temporal development of the breastfed infant gut microbiome over the first 12 months of life in the BLOSOM birth cohort.
Methods. Infant stool samples were collected at 2-5 days, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 12 months of age (n=684 samples from 85 infants). The gut microbiome was analysed using PacBio full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
Results. Exclusive breastfeeding was a strong determinant of the infant gut microbiome, with introduction of solid food driving a rapid and dramatic expansion in the gut community. Richness and Shannon diversity remained stable over the first 5 months of life, followed by a significant increase in diversity from 6 to 12 months (P&lt;0.0001). Bifidobacterium was the dominant genera in this cohort, with Bifidobacterium longum supsp. infantis representing the most abundant species (27% relative abundance across all samples). Bifidobacterium relative abundance increased across the first 4 months of life from a mean relative abundance of 23% at 2-5 days to 46% at 4 months. Bifidobacterium levels then began to steadily decline from 5 to 12 months (12 month mean relative abundance = 33%). The persistence of this health-promoting genera a 12 months of age is likely a reflection of the high breastfeeding retention rates in the BLOSOM cohort (&gt;80% still breastfeeding at 12 months of age). C-section delivery was a major determinant of the infant gut microbiome, with significant impacts on Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides. Similar impacts were seen in vaginally delivered infants whose mothers were exposed to intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, suggesting that antibiotic exposure related to delivery mode, rather than delivery mode per se, is responsible for the effect.
Conclusion. In the first study of gut microbiome assembly in exclusively breastfed Australian infants, we demonstrate a high abundance of Bifidobacterium that persists to 12 months of age. Our results also demonstrate the dramatic impact of introduction of solid foods, and exposure to intra-partum antibiotics.

Here we evaluate recent studies that characterized microbial populations in human fetuses from the perspectives of reproductive biology, microbial ecology, bioinformatics, immunology, clinical microbiology and gnotobiology, and assess possible mechanisms by which the fetus might interact with microorganisms. Our analysis indicates that the detected microbial signals are likely the result of contamination during the clinical procedures to obtain fetal samples or during DNA extraction and DNA sequencing. Furthermore, the existence of live and replicating microbial populations in healthy fetal tissues is not compatible with fundamental concepts of immunology, clinical microbiology and the derivation of germ-free mammals.

Abstract of this talk: Whether the human fetus and the prenatal intrauterine environment (amniotic fluid and placenta) are stably colonized by microbial communities in a healthy pregnancy remains a subject of debate. Here we evaluate recent studies that characterized microbial populations in human fetuses from the perspectives of reproductive biology, microbial ecology, bioinformatics, immunology, clinical microbiology and gnotobiology, and assess possible mechanisms by which the fetus might interact with microorganisms. Our analysis indicates that the detected microbial signals are likely the result of contamination during the clinical procedures to obtain fetal samples or during DNA extraction and DNA sequencing. Furthermore, the existence of live and replicating microbial populations in healthy fetal tissues is not compatible with fundamental concepts of immunology, clinical microbiology and the derivation of germ-free mammals. These conclusions are important to our understanding of human immune development and illustrate common pitfalls in the microbial analyses of many other low-biomass environments. The pursuit of a fetal microbiome serves as a cautionary example of the challenges of sequence-based microbiome studies when biomass is low or absent, and emphasizes the need for a trans-disciplinary approach that goes beyond contamination controls by also incorporating biological, ecological and mechanistic concepts

Social network interactions may thereby also shape the composition and diversity of the microbiome at individual and population levels. Here, we use comprehensive social network and detailed microbiome sequencing data in 1,098 adults across 9 isolated villages in Honduras to investigate the relationship between social network structure and microbiome composition. Using both species-level and strain-level data, we show that microbial sharing occurs between many relationship types, notably including non-familial and non-household connections. Using strain-sharing data alone, we can confidently predict a wide variety of relationship types (AUC ~0.73). This strain-level sharing extends to second-degree social connections in a network, suggesting the importance of the extended network with respect to microbiome composition. We also observe that socially central individuals are more microbially similar to the overall village than those on the social periphery. Finally, we observe that clusters of microbiome species and strains occur within clusters of people in the village social networks, providing the social niches in which microbiome biology and phenotypic impact are manifested.

Bacterial communities were assorted by gut location except in the mice receiving the control diet and DSS treatment (Beta-diversity, ANOVA, p lower than 0.05 for each).

Herein, we studied the contribution of the gut microbiota to TAC PK, using a combination of in vivo and in vitro models. Results. TAC oral administration was performed in mice. Compared to controls, mice with a lower intestinal microbial load due to antibiotics administration exhibit a 33% reduction in TAC whole blood exposure and a lower inter-individual variability. This reduction in TAC levels was strongly correlated with higher expression of the efflux transporter ABCB1 (also known as the p-glycoprotein (P-gp) or the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1)) in the small intestine. Conventionalization of germ-free mice confirmed the ability of the gut microbiota to downregulate ABCB1 expression in a site-specific fashion. The functional inhibition of ABCB1 in vivo by zosuquidar formally established the implication of this efflux transporter in the modulation of TAC PK by the gut microbiota. Furthermore, we showed that polar bacterial metabolites could recapitulate the transcriptional regulation of ABCB1 by the gut microbiota, without affecting its functionality. Finally, whole transcriptome analyses pinpointed, among others, the Constitutive Androstane Receptor (CAR) as a transcription factor likely to mediate the impact of the gut microbiota on ABCB1 transcriptional regulation. Conclusions. We highlight for the first time how the modulation of ABCB1 expression by bacterial metabolites results in changes in TAC PK, affecting not only blood levels but also the inter-individual variability. More broadly, considering the high number of drugs with unexplained PK variability transported by ABCB1, our work is of clinical importance and paves the way for incorporating the gut microbiota in prediction algorithms for dosage of such drugs.

Abstract: Background.  Following solid organ transplantation, tacrolimus (TAC) is an essential drug in the immunosuppressive strategy. Its use constitutes a challenge due to its narrow therapeutic index and its high inter- and intra- pharmacokinetic (PK) variability. As the contribution of the gut microbiota to drug metabolism is now emerging, it might be explored as one of the factors explaining TAC PK variability. Herein, we studied the contribution of the gut microbiota to TAC PK, using a combination of in vivo and in vitro models. Results.  TAC oral administration was performed in mice. Compared to controls, mice with a lower intestinal microbial load due to antibiotics administration exhibit a 33% reduction in TAC whole blood exposure and a lower inter-individual variability. This reduction in TAC levels was strongly correlated with higher expression of the efflux transporter ABCB1 (also known as the p-glycoprotein (P-gp) or the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1)) in the small intestine. Conventionalization of germ-free mice confirmed the ability of the gut microbiota to downregulate ABCB1 expression in a site-specific fashion. The functional inhibition of ABCB1 in vivo by zosuquidar formally established the implication of this efflux transporter in the modulation of TAC PK by the gut microbiota.

Recently, we reported that the most prevalent Corynebacterium species found on skin, including Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum and Corynebacterium kefirresidentii, comprise a narrow species complex despite the diversity of the genus. Here, we apply high-resolution phylogenomics and comparative genomics to describe the structure of the C. tuberculostearicum species complex and highlight genetic traits which are enriched or depleted in it relative to other Corynebacterium. Through metagenomic investigations, we also find that individual species within the complex can associate with specific body sites. Finally, we discover that one species from the complex, C. kefirresidentii, increases in relative abundance during atopic dermatitis flares, and show that most genomes of this species encode a colocalized set of putative virulence genes.

An increase in their prevalence has been associated with alterations in the gut microbiome, i.e., the microorganisms and their genes within the gastrointestinal tract. Maturation of the infant immune system and gut microbiota occur in parallel; thus, the conformation of the microbiome may determine if tolerant immune pro- gramming arises within the infant. Here we show, using deeply phenotyped participants in the CHILD birth cohort (n = 1115), that there are early-life influences and microbiome features which are uniformly associated with four distinct allergic diagnoses at 5 years: atopic dermatitis (AD, n = 367), asthma (As, n = 165), food allergy (FA, n = 136), and allergic rhinitis (AR, n = 187).

Abstract of this talk: Allergic diseases affect millions of people worldwide. An increase in their prevalence has been associated with alterations in the gut microbiome, i.e., the microorganisms and their genes within the gastrointestinal tract. Maturation of the infant immune system and gut microbiota occur in parallel; thus, the conformation of the microbiome may determine if tolerant immune pro- gramming arises within the infant. Here we show, using deeply phenotyped participants in the CHILD birth cohort (n = 1115), that there are early-life influences and microbiome features which are uniformly associated with four distinct allergic diagnoses at 5 years: atopic dermatitis (AD, n = 367), asthma (As, n = 165), food allergy (FA, n = 136), and allergic rhinitis (AR, n = 187). In a subset with shotgun metagenomic and metabolomic profiling (n = 589), we discover that impaired 1-year microbiota maturation may be universal to pediatric allergies (AD p = 0.000014; As p = 0.0073; FA p = 0.00083; and AR p = 0.0021). Extending this, we find a core set of functional and metabolic imbalances characterized by compromised mucous integrity, elevated oxida- tive activity, decreased secondary fermentation, and elevated trace amines, to be a significant mediator between microbiota maturation at age 1 year and allergic diagnoses at age 5 years (βindirect = −2.28; p = 0.0020). Microbiota maturation thus provides a focal point to identify deviations from normative development to predict and prevent allergic disease.

C. difficile infections (CDIs) are the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the U.S. and typically develop in individuals following disruption of the gut microbiota due to antibiotic or chemotherapy treatments. Further treatment of CDI with antibiotics is not always effective and can lead to antibiotic resistance and recurrent infections (rCDI). The most effective treatment for rCDI is the reestablishment of an intact microbiota via fecal microbiota transplants (FMTs). However, the success of FMTs has been difficult to generalize because the microbial interactions that prevent engraftment and facilitate the successful clearance of C. difficile are still only partially understood. Here we show how microbial community-scale metabolic models (MCMMs) accurately predicted known instances of C. difficile colonization susceptibility or resistance. MCMMs provide detailed mechanistic insights into the ecological interactions that govern C. difficile engraftment, like cross-feeding or competition involving metabolites like succinate, trehalose, and ornithine, which differ from person to person. Indeed, three distinct C. difficile metabolic niches emerge from our MCMMs, two associated with positive growth rates and one that represents non-growth, which are consistently observed across 14,862 individuals from four independent cohorts. Finally, we show how MCMMs can predict personalized engraftment and C. difficile growth suppression for a probiotic cocktail (VE303) designed to replace FMTs for the treatment rCDI. Overall, this powerful modeling approach predicts personalized C. difficile engraftment risk and can be leveraged to assess probiotic treatment efficacy. MCMMs could be extended to better understand personalized engraftment of other opportunistic bacterial pathogens, beneficial probiotic organisms, or more complex microbial consortia.

Extensive research has focused on assessing innovative feed formulations, particularly their impact on the fish gut microbiome. However, limited studies have investigated the microbiome of the aquaculture built environment and host-environment microbiome interactions.
Here, we explored the aquaculture ecosystem microbiome when insect-based novel feed formulations are administered. Using 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of microbiomes across water, tank biofilm, fish intestinal mucus, fish cutis, and feed samples.
Our results showed that overall, water and the aquaculture built environment were characterised by an astounding microbial diversity.
Core microbiome analysis unveiled a highly reduced core shared among all sample sources, in both the control and novel feed test groups.
Network analysis demonstrated sample clustering based on sample source, with no significant variations tied to the feed formulation. Consequently, the different diets did not appear to impact the environment (water and tank biofilm) and fish (cutis and intestinal mucus) microbiomes. For a more detailed examination of the feed's contribution, we conducted a differential abundance analysis, revealing distinct enrichment/depletion of specific taxa when comparing the control to the insect-based diet group.
The results of this study highlight how the aquaculture environment is a unique source of microbes, able to colonise fish.

Besides, compared to term infants, premature infants often receive antibiotics to treat infections and probiotics to restore optimal gut microbiota. How GA, antibiotics, and probiotics modulate the microbiota’s core characteristics, gut resistome and mobilome, remains nascent. Methods: We analysed metagenomic data from a longitudinal observational study in six Norwegian neonatal intensive care units to describe the bacterial microbiota of infants of varying GA and receiving different treatments. The cohort consisted of probiotic-supplemented and antibiotic-exposed extremely preterm infants (n = 29), antibiotic-exposed very preterm (n = 25), antibiotic-unexposed very preterm (n = 8), and antibiotic-unexposed full-term (n = 10) infants. The stool samples were collected on days of life 7, 28, 120, and 365, and DNA extraction was followed by shotgun metagenome sequencing and bioinformatical analysis. Findings: The top predictors of microbiota maturation were hospitalisation length and GA. Probiotic administration rendered the gut microbiota and resistome of extremely preterm infants more alike to term infants on day 7 and ameliorated GA-driven loss of microbiota interconnectivity and stability. GA, hospitalisation, and both microbiota-modifying treatments (antibiotics and probiotics) contributed to an elevated carriage of mobile genetic elements in preterm infants compared to term controls. Finally, Escherichia coli was associated with the highest number of antibiotic-resistance genes, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella aerogenes. Interpretation: Prolonged hospitalisation, antibiotics, and probiotic intervention contribute to dynamic alterations in resistome and mobilome, gut microbiota characteristics relevant to infection risk.

I am fascinated by the world of microbiomes and their potential role in human health and disease. Therefore, I am a link in a chain that focuses on fighting antibiotic resistance. So, without exaggeration, we are working to save the world from AMR danger that is projected to kill 10 million people by 2050. Pursuing my Ph.D. degree in Assoc. Prof. Veronika K. Petersen Lab at the Arctic University of Norway (UiT). Currently, my main project aims at understanding the effect of probiotics and antibiotics on the infants' gut microbiota, resistome, and mobilome composition using metagenomics approaches; besides integrating the metagenomics with the metabolome which is conducted by another Ph.D. candidate. While analyzing and collaborating on microbiome projects with bench researchers, clinicians, and scientists, I have realized that it is still very challenging for clinicians or bench researchers with no bioinformatics experience to handle, understand, and interpret this big omics data. The exploratory nature of data analysis makes the issue more complicated. Hence, my interest is to bridge this gap between data generation and data analysis skills. I have accepted invitations to collaborate on research with Professor Anne-Sofie Furberg at The Arctic University of Norway starting in February 2024, focusing on the prevalence and risk factors of antimicrobial resistance genes in Enterobacterales across a wide population. Additionally, from October 2023 to January 2024, I worked with Professor Yngvild Wasteson at NMBU on studies regarding the environmental dissemination of antibiotic-resistance genes and comparing different methodologies for identifying these genes. My tenure as a visiting researcher at Anne Salonen’s lab at the University of Helsinki from November to December 2023 involved conducting a comprehensive meta-analysis on the impact of early-life determinants on the gut resistome and mobilome of healthy, full-term infants.I have also contributed as an instructor for KJE-2004 Bioinformatics and R-for beginners courses, and am currently supervising two master's students researching the effects of travel, analgesic use, and proton pump inhibitors on the resistome, as well as the efficacy of various DNA extraction kits in identifying antibiotic resistance genes through quantitative PCR. During my master's, I worked on the evaluation of the impact of long-term amoxicillin administration on the human resistome using functional metagenomics. In the laboratory, I validated one of the discovered novel genes that could resist the PenicillinG at a MIC higher than the breakpoint reported by EUCAST by 300 times.

In particular, protists in the Parabasalia phylum reshape the intestinal immune landscape and influence host susceptibility to both infectious and inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanisms used by these protists to shape the gut environment remain poorly understood. Here, we identify a new species of commensal parabasalid in the mouse intestine, Tritrichomonas casperi. We find that metabolic differences between T. casperi and the closely related species Tritrichomonas musculis modulate their effects on host immunity and determine their ecological niche within the microbiota. First, we investigate metabolic output of these commensal parabasalids using genomic and metabolomic analysis. This reveals species-level differences in excretion of the tuft cell activating metabolite succinate, which causes differential remodeling of the immune system in the small intestine. Next, we investigate protist metabolic input by manipulating dietary fiber intake, as well as developing in vitro culture. This reveals that whereas T. musculis preferentially relies on dietary polysaccharides, T. casperi uses host mucus glycans as a carbon source. These carbon source preferences lead to differential competition with commensal bacteria in the intestine, including Bacteroidales spp. and Akkermansia muciniphila. These trans-kingdom interactions can in turn suppress protist-induced intestinal immune responses in a diet-dependent manner. Finally, we explore the diversity of commensal protists in humans by examining parabasalids in the microbiomes of both industrialized and non-industrialized populations. We identify multiple new species of commensal parabasalids in the microbiomes of non-industrialized populations, including novel human-associated tritrichomonads that are closely related T. musculis and T. casperi. Altogether, our findings elucidate how commensal parabasalid metabolism acts as a focal point for complex interactions with the host immune system, commensal bacteria, and diet, to impact intestinal immunity and host health.

Abstract of this talk: Commensal protists have historically been overlooked as members of the gut microbiota, but recent studies have highlighted the dominant effects of these commensals on the gut ecosystem. In particular, protists in the Parabasalia phylum reshape the intestinal immune landscape and influence host susceptibility to both infectious and inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanisms used by these protists to shape the gut environment remain poorly understood. Here, we identify a new species of commensal parabasalid in the mouse intestine, Tritrichomonas casperi. We find that metabolic differences between T. casperi and the closely related species Tritrichomonas musculis modulate their effects on host immunity and determine their ecological niche within the microbiota. First, we investigate metabolic output of these commensal parabasalids using genomic and metabolomic analysis. This reveals species-level differences in excretion of the tuft cell activating metabolite succinate, which causes differential remodeling of the immune system in the small intestine. Next, we investigate protist metabolic input by manipulating dietary fiber intake, as well as developing in vitro culture. This reveals that whereas T. musculis preferentially relies on dietary polysaccharides, T. casperi uses host mucus glycans as a carbon source. These carbon source preferences lead to differential competition with commensal bacteria in the intestine, including Bacteroidales spp. and Akkermansia muciniphila. These trans-kingdom interactions can in turn suppress protist-induced intestinal immune responses in a diet-dependent manner. Finally, we explore the diversity of commensal protists in humans by examining parabasalids in the microbiomes of both industrialized and non-industrialized populations. We identify multiple new species of commensal parabasalids in the microbiomes of non-industrialized populations, including novel human-associated tritrichomonads that are closely related T. musculis and T. casperi. Altogether, our findings elucidate how commensal parabasalid metabolism acts as a focal point for complex interactions with the host immune system, commensal bacteria, and diet, to impact intestinal immunity and host health.

After completing her medical degree, she entered surgical residency training at the Massachusetts General Hospital where she became interested in the biology and treatment of cancer. During her training, she completed two fellowships in surgical oncology with a focus on cancer immunotherapy. She was recruited to MGH in 2008 to join the faculty in the Division of Surgical Oncology and established a translational research laboratory focusing on better understanding response and resistance to treatment for melanoma, pancreatic cancer, and other cancers. During that time, her laboratory demonstrated that treatment with molecularly targeted therapy could sensitize tumor cells to treatment with immunotherapy, providing the rationale for combined targeted therapy and immunotherapy combinations. She also began studies on the tumor microbiome in pancreatic and other cancers while at Harvard. Jen was recruited to the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in 2013 to help lead the Melanoma Moonshot efforts - and also continued important translational research work on targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and the impact of the gut and tumor microbiome in cancer. Jen is currently a Professor of Surgical Oncology and Genomic Medicine, and the leader of the Platform for Innovative Microbiome and Translational Research (PRIME-TR) at MD Anderson. Importantly, Jen is deeply invested in working with investigators across the institution and across the world to find better ways to treat, intercept, and ultimately prevent cancer.",Department of Surgical Oncology,Professor ,grid.240145.6,https://i.imgur.com/2RoKfwu.jpeg,"Title of the presentation: ""Targeting the microbiome to promote health and end cancer""

We assessed if samples collected noninvasively, in this case, from common cranes (Grus grus), can be used for fecal microbiome research, comparing microbiota of noninvasively collected fecal samples to those collected from trapped common cranes at the same sites over the same period.

We found significant differences in fecal microbial composition (alpha and beta diversity), which likely did not result from noninvasive samples’ exposure to soil contaminants, as assessed by comparing bacterial oxygen use profiles. Differences might result from trapped birds’ exposure to sedatives or stress. We conclude that if all samples are collected in the same manner, comparative analyses are valid, and noninvasive sampling may better represent host fecal microbiota because there are no trapping effects.

To illustrate this point, combining movement data from GPS-tagged cranes with noninvasively sampled fecal microbiota samples of birds spatiotemporally overlapping with the tagged birds, we find evidence that supports the role of diet in structuring bacterial communities. We also show that the wild bird gut microbiota undergoes not only seasonal shifts but is also affected by management schemes and local agricultural practices.

Experiments with fresh and delayed sample collection can elucidate effects of environmental exposures on microbiota. Further, controlled tests of stressing or sedation may unravel how trapping affects wildlife microbiota, but our application already shows how valuable this method can be.

Here, we assessed gut microbiome composition by shotgun metagenomic profiling in an observational cross-sectional study on 288 individuals, consisting of patients with a diagnosis of neuroblastoma at disease onset (N=63), healthy controls matching the patients on the main covariates of microbiome composition (N=94), healthy siblings of the patients (N=13), mothers of patients (N=59), and mothers of the controls (N=59). We examined taxonomic and functional microbiome composition and mother-infant strain transmission patterns. Patients with neuroblastoma displayed alterations in gut microbiome composition characterised by reduced microbiome richness, decreased relative abundances of 18 species (including Phocaeicola dorei and Bifidobacterium bifidum), enriched protein fermentation and reduced carbohydrate fermentation potential. Using machine learning, we could successfully discriminate patients from controls (AUC = 82%). Healthy siblings did not display such alterations but resembled the healthy control group. No significant differences in maternal microbiome composition nor mother-to-offspring transmission were detected.

Therefore, the alterations in taxonomic and functional gut microbiome composition we described in patients with neuroblastoma, cannot be traced to differential maternal seeding and might arise subsequently.

Childhood mortality due to acute diarrhea (AD; less than 7 days of duration) is decreasing, but prolonged (ProD; 7-13 days of duration) and persistent (PD; more than 14 days of duration) diarrhea combined (ProPD) are responsible for increased morbidity and mortality in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs).
Objectives: This study aimed to characterize the gut microbiota (GM) composition of children with acute diarrhea (AD) and prolonged or persistent diarrhea (ProPD) by comparing GM composition between these two groups and with non-diarrheal controls in a case-control study.
Methods: The study included fecal samples from 1321 children 0-59 months old. After preprocessing based on sequencing depth, we analyzed the GM of 1313 children comparing 554 AD cases, 95 ProPD cases, and 663 frequency matched, non-diarrheal controls. All children were enrolled from Jimma, Ethiopia. The GM composition was determined using 16S rRNA gene (V4 region) amplicon sequencing. The observed zero-radius Operational Taxonomic Units (zOTUs) and Shannon diversity index were assessed, and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity metrics were generated and differences between groups evaluated by PERMANOVA. DESeq2 was used to determine taxa being differentially abundant between diarrhea subcategories and non-diarrheal controls.
Results: All diarrhea cases (AD and ProPD) combined and each group separately were associated with a decrease in bacterial diversity compared to non-diarrheal controls. Relative to non-diarrheal controls, the GM of children with AD or ProPD was enriched in Escherichia spp., Campylobacter spp., and Streptococcus spp. The GM of children with AD or ProPD was characterized by a decreased relative abundance of Prevotella copri, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Dialister succinatiphilus compared to non-diarrheal controls. Similarly, compared to AD cases, ProPD cases were characterized by a decreased relative abundance of important gut commensals such as F. prausnitzii, Akkermansia muciniphila, Eubacterium hadrum and Blautia spp.
Conclusion: The GM of children with AD and ProPD was enriched in putative pathogens as well as facultative anaerobes, while obligate anaerobes were reduced. The GM of children with ProPD was characterized by a more pronounced reduction of obligate anaerobic gut commensals compared to AD, suggesting that prolonged duration of diarrhea is accompanied by a depletion of healthy gut commensals. This indicates a potential role for targeted dietary supplements to restore gut eubiosis and/ or the use of next generation probiotics to improve ProPD treatment.",,,,gettesfaw2@gmail.com,Mr.,Getnet Tesfaw Tadege,https://food.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/643638,-,Department of Food Science,PhD student,grid.5254.6,https://i.imgur.com/0XVSGt3.jpeg,"Title of the presentation: ""Gut microbiota patterns associated with duration of diarrhea in children under five years of age in Ethiopia""

In this study, our objective was to evaluate whether a selenium-rich postbiotic composed of whole-cell Saccharomyces cerevisiae ABB S12, Kluyveromyces marxianus ABB S8 and Saccharomyces boulardii ABB S3 yeast strains, can act as provider of selenium to enhance the function of the human immune system after oral intake.
Methods and findings: A total of 15 volunteers were enrolled in a 28-day clinical study in which they complemented their normal diets with a daily dose of a novel selenium food supplement, “postbiotic immune”. Selenium levels in plasma were quantified by ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay), and the proliferation and activation of different subsets of lymphocytes isolated from PBMC’s (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells) were assessed by flow cytometry using different cell markers. At the end of the study, we observed a higher proliferative capacity of total lymphocytes and specifically, of CD16+ lymphocytes (natural killer cells), upon stimulation with the CD3 and CD28 antibodies mimicking cell activation in vitro. Interestingly, we did not observe an increase in the activation of the lymphocyte subsets CD4+ (T helper cells) but CD16+, indicating that that there was a specific activation of natural killer cells.
Conclusions: Altogether, our results suggest that orally ingested ”Postbiotic immune” primes the human immune system to elicit a faster and more efficient immune response through the specific activation of natural killer cells.

Second, our understanding of the human microbiome and its relationship with public health remains limited. Pathogens have been examined by centuries of microbiology and epidemiology, but we know relatively little about the transmission or heritability of the normal commensal microbiota, its carriage of pathogenic functionality, or its interaction with host immunity, environment, and genetics.

Gut microbiota may partially mediate this association and could be potential targets for intervention; however, its role is understudied. We included 1,592 infants from the Canadian Healthy Infants Longitudinal Development Cohort. Data on environmental exposure and lifestyle factors were collected prenatally and throughout the first three years. Weight outcomes were measured at one and three years of age. Stool samples collected at 3 and 12 months were analyzed by sequencing the V4 region of 16S rRNA to profile microbial compositions and magnetic resonance spectroscopy to quantify the metabolites. We showed that quitting smoking during pregnancy did not lower the risk of offspring being overweight. However, exclusive breastfeeding until the third month of age may alleviate these risks. We also reported that maternal smoking during pregnancy significantly increased Firmicutes abundance and diversity. We further revealed that Firmicutes diversity mediates the elevated risk of childhood overweight and obesity linked to maternal prenatal smoking. This effect possibly occurs through excessive microbial butyrate production. These findings add to the evidence that women should quit smoking before their pregnancies to prevent microbiome-mediated childhood overweight and obesity risk, and indicate the potential obesogenic role of excessive butyrate production in early life.

Engineered biosensing bacteria outfitted with such circuits can potentially probe the human gut microbiome to prevent, diagnose, or treat disease. To provide robust biocontainment for engineered bacteria, we devised a Cas9-assisted auxotrophic biocontainment system combining thymidine auxotrophy, an Engineered Riboregulator (ER) for controlled gene expression, and a CRISPR Device (CD). The CD prevents the engineered bacteria from acquiring thyA via horizontal gene transfer, which would disrupt the biocontainment system, and inhibits the spread of genetic elements by killing bacteria harboring the gene cassette. This system tunably controlled gene expression in the human gut commensal bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, prevented escape from thymidine auxotrophy, and blocked transgene dissemination. These capabilities were validated in vitro and in vivo. This biocontainment system exemplifies a powerful strategy for bringing genetically engineered microorganisms safely into biomedicine.

Abstract of this talk: Today, microbiome knowledge and research is largely restricted to high- and middle-income countries, especially in North America, Europe as well as Asia. As the microbiome varies across geographies and lifestyles, it is of utmost importance to fill these “white gaps” and include also with communities and age groups that did not participate in these efforts to date. Many of these communities are- for different reasons- considered as vulnerable populations and including them in microbiome research thus poses many important ethical questions. In this presentation, I aim to give examples of ethical questions and constraints that arise when working on the microbiome of vulnerable populations. Giving examples from our research on the microbiome of undernourished children and their families from the Global South over the last years, I aim to stimulate discussion and reflection on these questions, to foster even better and more inclusive collaborations across cultures, disciplines and social structures in the future."

In addition, the limited research on other understudied populations is not without its ethical quandaries either. In this presentation, I discuss and clarify these ethical issues by disentangling these into 3 main subsets: European and North American bias, cultural insensitivity, and lack of meaningful collaboration and inclusion. Thereafter, I propose an overall approach to solving these quandaries by introducing the notion of radical interdisciplinary co-laboration, in which different academic and non-academic stakeholders mediate their knowledges and labor together in studying human microbiomes. I will elicit how the proposed approach will render microbiome science more ethical and at the same time render the very science of microbiomes more precise and rigorous.",,,,wim.van.daele@uia.no,Assoc.

However, populations from low- and middle-income countries, which represent ∼84% of the world population, have been excluded from large-scale gut microbiome research. Here, we present the AWI-Gen 2 Microbiome Project, a cross-sectional gut microbiome study sampling 1,803 women from Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa. By intensively engaging with communities that range from rural and horticultural to urban informal settlements and post-industrial, we capture population diversity that represents a far greater breadth of the world’s population. Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we find that study site explains substantially more microbial variation than disease status. We identify taxa with strong geographic and lifestyle associations, including loss of Treponema and Cryptobacteroides species and gain of Bifidobacterium species in urban populations. We uncover a wealth of prokaryotic and viral novelty, including 1,005 new bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes, and identify phylogeography signatures in Treponema succinifaciens. Finally, we find a microbiome signature of HIV infection that is defined by several taxa not previously associated with HIV, including Dysosmobacter welbionis and Enterocloster sp. This study represents the largest population-representative survey of gut metagenomes of African individuals to date, and paired with extensive clinical biomarkers, demographic data, and lifestyle information, provides extensive opportunity for microbiome-related discovery and research.
