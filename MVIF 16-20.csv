In particular, intestinal roundworms such as Ascaris suum affect more than 1 billion people around the globe and are a major issue in animal husbandry. These pathogens live in intimate contact with the host gut microbiota and harbor bacteria within their own intestines.

Abstract of this talk: Intestinal helminths are extremely prevalent among humans and animals. In particular, intestinal roundworms such as Ascaris suum affect more than 1 billion people around the globe and are a major issue in animal husbandry. These pathogens live in intimate contact with the host gut microbiota and harbor bacteria within their own intestines. Knowledge of the bacterial host microbiome at the site of infection is limited and data on the parasite microbiome is, to the best of our knowledge, non-existent.  The intestinal microbiome of Ascaris suum was analyzed in contrast to the diversity and composition of the infected host gut. 16S sequencing of the parasite intestine and host intestinal compartments showed that the parasite gut has a significantly less diverse microbiome than its host and the host gut exhibits a reduced microbiome diversity at the site of parasite infection in the jejunum. While the host’s microbiome composition at the site of infection significantly determines the microbiome composition of its parasite, microbial signatures differentiate the nematodes from their hosts as the Ascaris intestine supports the growth of microbes that are otherwise under-represented in the host gut.  Our data clearly indicate that a nematode infection reduces the microbiome diversity of the host gut and that the nematode gut represents a selective bacterial niche harboring bacteria that are derived but distinct from the host gut.

Even though recent studies have highlighted the apparent importance of these novel genes, their overall significance is still largely unexplored. Here, we applied a comprehensive comparative genomics approach to identify high-quality novel protein families exclusive from uncultivated species, and characterized them from a functional, ecological and evolutionary point of view. For such a purpose, we computed protein families from a large multi-habitat metagenomic dataset covering 400M genes from 170k genomes spanning the prokaryotic phylogeny. We then applied strict quality and novelty filters to avoid incomplete genes, assembling artifacts, distant homologs and potential pseudogenes. This led us to uncovering 400K high-quality gene families exclusive from uncultivated taxa, twice the number of gene families in reference databases like EggNOG. These high-quality novel gene families are widespread within and across habitats, indicating their ecological value. They also spread out across the microbial phylogeny and are notably overrepresented in recently discovered taxa. Most remarkably, we found that 980 previously neglected protein families can accurately distinguish entire uncultivated phyla, classes and orders, likely representing synapomorphic traits. We inferred the putative functional roles of the high-quality novel gene families by reconstructing their genomic neighborhood and estimating their degree of functional context conservation. 18% of the novel protein families are present in phylogenetically conserved operon regions, in some cases involving key metabolic genes, suggesting they may take part in central microbial processes. In order to facilitate the characterization of novel gene families in relevant genomic contexts, we developed http://novelgenefamilies.compgenomics.org, which allows to browse and visualize the genomic neighbors of any of our novel gene family predictions.

Assembly of the human gut microbiome during early life is a complex and dynamic process. Aberrations to the early gut microbiome have been repeatedly associated with later-life disease. While previous studies have explored the temporal development of the infant gut microbiome, none have done so in an exclusively breastfed population, nor in an Australian context. Here, we characterized the temporal development of the breastfed infant gut microbiome over the first 12 months of life in the BLOSOM birth cohort.
Methods. Infant stool samples were collected at 2-5 days, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 12 months of age (n=684 samples from 85 infants). The gut microbiome was analysed using PacBio full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
Results. Exclusive breastfeeding was a strong determinant of the infant gut microbiome, with introduction of solid food driving a rapid and dramatic expansion in the gut community. Richness and Shannon diversity remained stable over the first 5 months of life, followed by a significant increase in diversity from 6 to 12 months (P&lt;0.0001). Bifidobacterium was the dominant genera in this cohort, with Bifidobacterium longum supsp. infantis representing the most abundant species (27% relative abundance across all samples). Bifidobacterium relative abundance increased across the first 4 months of life from a mean relative abundance of 23% at 2-5 days to 46% at 4 months.

Abstract of this talk: Background. Assembly of the human gut microbiome during early life is a complex and dynamic process. Aberrations to the early gut microbiome have been repeatedly associated with later-life disease. While previous studies have explored the temporal development of the infant gut microbiome, none have done so in an exclusively breastfed population, nor in an Australian context. Here, we characterized the temporal development of the breastfed infant gut microbiome over the first 12 months of life in the BLOSOM birth cohort.
Methods. Infant stool samples were collected at 2-5 days, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 12 months of age (n=684 samples from 85 infants). The gut microbiome was analysed using PacBio full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
Results. Exclusive breastfeeding was a strong determinant of the infant gut microbiome, with introduction of solid food driving a rapid and dramatic expansion in the gut community. Richness and Shannon diversity remained stable over the first 5 months of life, followed by a significant increase in diversity from 6 to 12 months (P&lt;0.0001). Bifidobacterium was the dominant genera in this cohort, with Bifidobacterium longum supsp. infantis representing the most abundant species (27% relative abundance across all samples). Bifidobacterium relative abundance increased across the first 4 months of life from a mean relative abundance of 23% at 2-5 days to 46% at 4 months. Bifidobacterium levels then began to steadily decline from 5 to 12 months (12 month mean relative abundance = 33%). The persistence of this health-promoting genera a 12 months of age is likely a reflection of the high breastfeeding retention rates in the BLOSOM cohort (&gt;80% still breastfeeding at 12 months of age). C-section delivery was a major determinant of the infant gut microbiome, with significant impacts on Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides. Similar impacts were seen in vaginally delivered infants whose mothers were exposed to intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, suggesting that antibiotic exposure related to delivery mode, rather than delivery mode per se, is responsible for the effect.
Conclusion. In the first study of gut microbiome assembly in exclusively breastfed Australian infants, we demonstrate a high abundance of Bifidobacterium that persists to 12 months of age. Our results also demonstrate the dramatic impact of introduction of solid foods, and exposure to intra-partum antibiotics.

Social network interactions may thereby also shape the composition and diversity of the microbiome at individual and population levels. Here, we use comprehensive social network and detailed microbiome sequencing data in 1,098 adults across 9 isolated villages in Honduras to investigate the relationship between social network structure and microbiome composition. Using both species-level and strain-level data, we show that microbial sharing occurs between many relationship types, notably including non-familial and non-household connections. Using strain-sharing data alone, we can confidently predict a wide variety of relationship types (AUC ~0.73). This strain-level sharing extends to second-degree social connections in a network, suggesting the importance of the extended network with respect to microbiome composition. We also observe that socially central individuals are more microbially similar to the overall village than those on the social periphery.

Ongoing research has identified inactive compounds in broccoli sprouts, like glucoraphanin, and that mammalian gut microbiota play a role in metabolizing it to the anti-inflammatory sulforaphane. The objectives were to identify biogeographic location of participating microbiota and correlate that to health outcomes. We fed specific pathogen free C57BL/6 mice either a control diet or a 10% steamed broccoli sprout diet, and gave a three-cycle regimen of 2.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water over a 40-day experiment to simulate chronic, relapsing ulcerative colitis. We monitored body weight, fecal characteristics, fecal lipocalin, and sequenced bacterial communities from the contents and mucosa in the jejunum, cecum, and colon. Mice fed the broccoli sprout diet while receiving DSS performed better than mice fed the control diet while receiving DSS for all disease parameters, including significantly more weight gain (2-way ANOVA, p lower than 0.05), lower Disease Activity Index scores (2-way ANOVA, p lower than 0.001), and higher bacterial richness in all gut locations (linear regression model, p lower than 0.01 for all locations measured). Bacterial communities were assorted by gut location except in the mice receiving the control diet and DSS treatment (Beta-diversity, ANOVA, p lower than 0.05 for each). Importantly, our results suggested that broccoli sprout feeding completely abrogated the effects of DSS on gut microbiota, as bacterial communities were similar between mice receiving broccoli sprouts with and without DSS. Spatially resolved microbial communities provide greater insight when investigating host-microbe interactions. Here, we show that a 10% broccoli sprout diet protects mice from the negative effects of dextran sodium sulfate induced colitis, that colitis erases biogeographical patterns of bacterial communities in the gut, and that the cecum is not likely to be a significant contributor to colonic bacteria of interest in the DSS mouse model of ulcerative colitis.
