                            "abstract": "Coevolution of humans with gut bacteria requires a shared evolutionary history. Host-microbial cophylogeny has been shown for hominids, but within humans, only the stomach bacterium Helicobacter pylori is known to have codiversified with its host. Human populations are known to harbor distinct strains of bacterial species and this is generally attributed to differences in environment and diet, however, codiversification through long-term associations could also contribute to these patterns. To test for cophylogeny between gut microbiota and their human hosts, we analyzed paired human genotypes and bacterial strain genotypes from fecal metagenomes obtained from five countries. Our results indicate that strains of common gut bacteria have transmitted vertically for thousands of generations. In accord, strains displaying patterns of cophylogeny are also shared between mothers and infants. Patterns of strain transfer between populations are consistent with an African origin for taxa showing cophylogeny. Our results indicate long-term fidelity of gut microbial strains with human populations, creating opportunities for coevolution.",

Using the largest collection of more than 1,000 unique bacterial strains cultured from a combination of 22 FMT donors and recipients with recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI), we develop an approach Strainer for detection and tracking of bacterial strains from metagenomic sequencing data. On application to 13 FMT interventions, we detect stable and high engraftment of 71% of microbiota strains in recipients at even 5-years post-transplant, a remarkably durable therapeutic from a single administration. Although ~80% of the original pre-FMT recipient strains were eliminated by the FMT, those strains that remain persist even 5 years later, along with newer strains acquired from the environment. The precise quantification of donor bacterial strain engraftment in recipients independently explained (precision 100%, recall 95%) the clinical outcomes of relapse or success after both initial and repeat-FMT. We next apply this to the largest successful FMT trial for patients with Ulcerative Colitis (FOCUS study), and found both overall and specific high engraftment of certain bacterial strains and species in patients that achieved the primary endpoint of steroid-free clinical remission with endoscopic remission or response. We provide a list of bacterial species and strains that are present in multiple donors and consistently engraft in recipients over time, for use in Live Biotherapeutic Products (LBP) as a safer alternative to FMT. Our framework can enable the systematic evaluation of different FMT and LBP study designs by quantification of strain engraftment in recipients.",

We demonstrate highly-variable degrees of ex vivo colonization resistance against a carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strain in human feces samples and subsequently isolated from protected donors diverse K. oxytoca strains. Several of these K. oxytoca strains reduced gut colonization of MDR K. pneumoniae strains in antibiotic-treated and gnotobiotic mouse models. Comparative analysis of K. oxytoca strains identified competition for specific carbohydrates as a key factor for colonization resistance. In addition to direct competition between K. oxytoca and K. pneumoniae, cooperation with additional commensals was required to reestablish full colonization resistance and gut decolonization. Finally, K. oxytoca also protected humanized microbiota mice generated from susceptible donors against K. pneumoniae colonization demonstrating the potential of commensal K. oxytoca strains as next-generation probiotics.",

In its second challenge, CAMI engaged the community to assess their methods on realistic and complex metagenomic datasets with long and short reads, created from \u223c1,700 novel and known microbial genomes, as well as \u223c600 novel plasmids and viruses. Altogether 5,002 results by 76 program versions were analyzed, representing a 22x increase in results.\n\nSubstantial improvements were seen in metagenome assembly, some due to using long-read data. The presence of related strains still was challenging for assembly and genome binning, as was assembly quality for the latter. Taxon profilers demonstrated a marked maturation, with taxon profilers and binners excelling at higher bacterial taxonomic ranks, but underperforming for viruses and archaea. Assessment of clinical pathogen detection techniques revealed a need to improve reproducibility. Analysis of program runtimes and memory usage identified highly efficient programs, including some top performers with other metrics. The CAMI II results identify current challenges, but also guide researchers in selecting methods for specific analyses.",

                            "abstract": "Bacterial bloodstream infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality among patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Although previous research has demonstrated that pathogenic organisms may translocate from the gut microbiome into the bloodstream to cause infections, the mechanisms by which HCT patients acquire pathogens in their microbiome have not yet been described. We hypothesized that patient-patient transmission may be responsible for pathogens colonizing the microbiome of HCT patients, and that patients who share time and space in the hospital are more likely to share bacterial strains.\n \nHere, we used linked-read and short-read metagenomic sequencing to analyze 401 stool samples collected from 149 adults undergoing HCT and hospitalized in the same unit over a period of three years. We used metagenomic assembly and strain-specific comparison methods to investigate transmission of gut microbiota between individuals. While transmission of pathogens was found to be rare, we did observe four pairs of patients who harbor identical or nearly identical E. faecium strains in their microbiome. These strains may be the result of transmission between patients who shared a room and bathroom, acquisition from a common source in the hospital or transmission from an unsampled source.\n \nWe also observed identical Akkermansia muciniphila and Hungatella hathewayi strains in two pairs of patients. In both cases, the patients were roommates for at least one day, the strain was absent in the putative recipient\u2019s microbiome prior to the period of roommate overlap and the putative recipient had a microbiome perturbed by antibiotic treatment for a bloodstream infection. Finally, we identified multiple patients who acquired identical strains of several species commonly found in commercial probiotics and dairy products, including Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus gasseri and Streptococcus thermophilus. Overall, the limited amount of putative transmission observed indicates that current infection control and contact precautions are successful in preventing interpersonal exchange of microbes. However, the potential transmission of commensal microbes with immunomodulatory properties raises interesting questions about the recovery of microbiome diversity after HCT, and indicates that patients in this setting may acquire new microbes by sharing space with others.",

However, microbial pathogenicity, resistance, and adaptation therein remain unknown, especially identifying the genetic mobility of resistance and pathogenicity in unculturable trench bacteria is a great challenge. This study aims to depict the landscape of virulome, antibiotic resistome and mobilome of the hadal zone microbiota of the Mariana Trench.\n\nMethod: The landscape of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes was depicted based on high-throughput metagenomic sequencing analysis using both sequence-based and domain-based annotation methods. The mobility and spread potentials of ARGs and virulence genes via horizontal gene transfer (HGT) were examined by checking their co-occurrence with MGEs.\n\nResults and Discussion: i) the Challenger Deep bottom (10,898-m) sediment harbored prosperous microbiota with contrasting signatures of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance (Fig. 1b and 2b), compared with the other Marian Trench sediment; ii) both the abundance and richness of ARGs greatly differed across sediment sites in the following increasing trend: SM10898 - SM6038 - SP5856 (Fig. 2a). Surprisingly, the bottom site of the Challenger Deep was found to still harbor 20 subtypes of known ARGs. Both the abundance (1.08 to 1.12\u00d710-1 GP16S each) and diversity (127 to 153 subtypes) of the hadal seawater ARGs (Fig. 2b) were surprisingly high in the hadal seawater of the Mariana trench. The abundance of ARGs in seawater is higher than that in sediments by up to two orders of magnitude, deterministic natural processes drivers the resistome differences between hadal sediment and seawater including habitat (environmental) filtering and biotic interactions (e.g., competition). iii) HGT mediated by phage and integrase as the major mechanism for the evolution of Mariana Trench sediment bacteria (Fig. 3a); iv) substantial co-selection of virulence genes and ARGs in taxonomically diverse bacteria in the hadal sediment, especially for the Challenger Deep bottom where mobilized ARGs and virulence genes are favorably enriched in largely unexplored bacteria (Fig. 4).",

                            "abstract": "High-throughput sequencing is commonly used to study microorganisms in the environment without a need for culturing. Computational analysis of metagenomic has enabled the construction of large compendia of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from human-, animal-associated and environmental samples. Metagenomic binning is the step in the standard pipeline which groups the contigs into bins such that each bin is predicted to contain only contigs from the same genome.\n\nBinning methods can be divided into reference-dependent (based on reference genomes) and reference-independent methods (operating de novo). Compared to reference-dependent methods, reference-independent methods can discover new species or even new phyla, but completely ignore any background information. To combine the advantages of these two categories, we propose a novel binning method called SemiBin which uses a semi-supervised neural network to incorporate information from reference genomes, while still being capable of finding novel species. SemiBin outperforms existing state-of-the-art binning methods in simulated and real microbiome datasets across three different environments (human gut, dog gut, and marine environments). SemiBin returns more high-quality bins (48.0-99.2% more in single-sample mode; 11.0-30.7% more in multi-sample mode, compared to the second-best alternative). Compared to the alternatives, SemiBin captures a larger taxonomic diversity, including more distinct genera and species. In particular, we verified that SemiBin can retrieve more genomes from both known and novel species.\n\nSemiBin is available as open source software at https://github.com/BigDataBiology/SemiBin/.",

The cognitive-interoceptive appraisal of threat-related stimuli relies on dynamic neural computations between the anterior insular (AIC) and the dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) cortices. If, to what extent, and how microbial consortia influence the activity of this cortical threat processing circuitry is unclear. We addressed this question by combining a threat processing task, neuroimaging, 16S rRNA profiling, and computational modelling in healthy participants. Results showed interactions between high-level ecological indices with threat-related AIC-dACC neural dynamics. At finer taxonomic resolutions, the abundance of Ruminococcus was differentially linked to connectivity between, and activity within the AIC and dACC during threat updating. Functional inference analysis provides a strong rationale to motivate future investigations of microbiota-derived metabolites in the observed relationship with threat-related brain processes.",

                            "abstract": "Culture-independent analyses of microbial communities dramatically improved in the last decade, thanks to advances in methods for biological profiling via shotgun metagenomics and other molecular methods. This opens new opportunities for large-scale assembly efforts and the improvement of analysis tools with greater access to multi-omics, microbial reference genomes, and strain-level diversity. To leverage these, we present bioBakery 3, a set of integrated and improved methods for taxonomic, strain-level, functional, and phylogenetic profiling of metagenomes based on the largest set of reference sequences now available. MetaPhlAn 3 and HUMAnN 3 provides more accurate taxonomic and functional potential and activity profiles, respectively. These methods detected novel disease-microbiome links in CRC and IBD cohorts. Strain-level profiling of 4,077 metagenomes with StrainPhlAn 3 and PanPhlAn 3 unravelled the phylogenetic and functional structure of the gut microbe Ruminococcus bromii, previously described by only 15 isolate genomes. Phylogenetic analysis with PhyloPhlAn 3 supports both genomic and metagenomic data, by assigning genomes from isolate sequencing or metagenomic assemblies to species-level genome bins defined on more than 230,000 publically available sequences. It also accurately reconstructs phylogenies at different resolutions (from strain-level to microbial tree-of-life) using maximally informative markers. The bioBakery 3 is open-source and includes documentation, training data, and cloud-deployable reproducible workflows to help researchers deepen the resolution, scale, and accuracy of multi-omic profiling for microbial communities. The ability to use metagenomic assemblies further help to study uncharacterized microbial species not represented by isolate genomes.\n\narticle: https://elifesciences.org/articles/65088",

                            "abstract": "The dramatic increase of chronic diseases in industrialized societies might be driven in part by a disruption of gut microbiome composition and function (e.g., reduced fiber fermentation) and impaired intestinal barrier integrity. We developed a microbiome restoration strategy based on a diet that resembles key aspects of a non-industrialized diet (Non-Ind) and a probiotic Limosilactobacillus reuteri (a species rarely found in microbiome from industrialized populations). Using a randomized controlled pilot study, 30 participants consumed either the Non-Ind diet or their usual diet in a crossover fashion for three weeks each. Participants were also divided into three groups and consumed either a single dose of one of two Lm. reuteri strains or a placebo on day four of each diet period. The Non-Ind diet enhanced the temporal persistence of one of the Lm. reuteri strains, but had no measurable effects on microbiome and host. In contrast, the Non-Ind diet shifted overall fecal microbiome composition (R2=0.015, p=0.001; ADONIS), and significantly altered 56% of Amplicon Sequence Variants obtained from 16S dataset (FDR lower than 0.05), 22% of species-level genome bins, and 21% of metabolic pathways obtained from metagenomic dataset (FDR lower than 0.05). Bacteria fermentation was enhanced, exhibited by increased concentration of total fecal short-chain fatty acids (+10.7%, p=0.03) and reduced fecal pH (-3.8%, p=0.002). Furthermore, we observed reductions in six chronic disease risk markers (all p lower than 0.01): total cholesterol (-14.1%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-16.8%), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (-11.3%), non-HDL cholesterol (-15.2%), glucose (-6.3%), and C-reactive protein (-14.2%). The diet also reduced fecal calprotectin (-21.0%, p=0.002) and zonulin levels (-14.9%, p=0.025) that are markers of gut inflammation and impaired barrier functions, respectively. Our study demonstrates pronounced beneficial effects of a microbiome restoration strategy based on the Non-Ind diet on metabolic markers of health. The findings provide valuable information for improving human health in modern societies. Ongoing analyses are exploring the mechanistic links between diet-induced changes in the gut microbiome and the physiological effects on the host.",

                            "abstract": "The vast majority of bacteria that can be grown in a laboratory remain genetically intractable, beyond the power of genetics for elucidating function or engineering for human use. Inherent diversity of genetic defenses, primarily Restriction-Modification (RM) systems, across bacterial species and individual strains remains a fundamental barrier to human-made DNA constructs during genetic engineering of bacteria. Previously, we described an approach to evade RM systems through the creation of SyngenicDNA; de-novo synthesized DNA sequences that are precisely altered to achieve epigenetic compatibility with a desired bacterial host and to prevent RM defense activation upon artificial transformation. SyngenicDNA-based genetic tools have increased transformation efficiencies by several orders of magnitude, yet still require manual ad-hoc sequence alterations for their generation. To remove the need for manual introduction of site-specific DNA alterations in silico, and to improve the accessibility, speed of generation, and reproducibility of SyngenicDNA, we introduce the SyngenicDNA Tool Generator (SyToGen). SyToGen is a computational workbench designed to assist users who work with bacteria that are currently genetically intractable. The software adheres to the manual workflow for generating SyngenicDNA, namely target identification, in silico tool assembly and sequence adaptation, but rapidly and reproducibly provides users with RM-silent DNA templates for de novo synthesis and assembly. SyToGen output plasmid sequences retain the form and functionality of the original genetic tool, but are now uniquely re-designed at the DNA level to bypass RM barriers and operate within the specific bacterium of interest.",

                            "abstract": "Preterm birth (PTB) is the leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. The vaginal microbiome has been associated with PTB, yet the mechanisms underlying this association remain largely unexplained. Our understanding of these associations could be informed by detecting microbial genomic adaptation to host-related stresses. To this end, we analyzed metagenomic data from 705 vaginal samples collected longitudinally during pregnancy from 40 women who delivered preterm spontaneously and 135 term controls from the Multi-Omic Microbiome Study-Pregnancy Initiative (MOMS-PI). We assembled 1,078 metagenome-assembled genomes, representing 157 species-level taxa from at least 8 bacterial phyla. We find that the vaginal microbiome of pregnancies that ended in PTB exhibits unique genetic profiles. Compared to pregnancies ending at term, it is more genetically diverse and harbors more virulence genes. It also harbors higher richness and diversity of antimicrobial resistant genes, likely promoted by plasmids. Interestingly, we found that Gardnerella vaginalis, a central vaginal pathobiont, is driving this high genetic diversity, particularly its genes involved in ribosome pathways and metabolism. We present evidence that this species undergoes more frequent recombination and stronger purifying selection in pregnancies which ended preterm. We further showed that the PTB-associated population structure of G. vaginalis may be related to optimization of growth rates. Overall, our results reveal novel associations between the vaginal microbiome and PTB from a population genetics perspective, and suggest that evolutionary processes acting on the vaginal microbiome may play a vital role in adverse pregnancy outcomes.",

                            "abstract": "To date, the human gut is recognized as primary reservoir of extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) strains, followed by vagina. However, since the discovery of urinary microbiome, the origin of microbes associated with UTI is of high interest. We aimed to explore population diversity of E. coli strains identified in urogenital microbiome of asymptomatic and recurrent UTI (rUTI) women. Additionally, we investigated genomic relation between E. coli strains isolated from healthy and diseased host. We performed thorough characterization [41 virulence-associated genes (VAGs) and phylogenetic groups] of 70 E. coli recovered from voided urine and vaginal samples. We further performed whole genome sequencing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 11 representative B2 ExPEC clones. Following, we performed SNP-based phylogenetic analysis and comparative genomics with E. coli genomes available in public databases, focusing on ST131 lineage. We identified E. coli in 48% of asymptomatic women and in all rUTI women. We observed different E. coli prevalence in urine (29%) and in vaginal samples (37%). Most of women were colonized by only one strain, while in 4 women we found more than one E. coli strain in urine and/or vagina. The most frequently identified phylogenetic group was B2 (56%) followed mostly by F and D. Most B2 and all F strains were classified as ExPEC and possess an array of VAGs, independently of host health status. Hierarchical clustering based on VAGs presence/absence confirmed that it is not possible to distinguish strains isolated from healthy and rUTI host based on their VAG profiles. We identified well recognized widespread lineages among our isolates e.g., sequence types (ST) 127, ST131, ST140 (asymptomatic) and ST12, ST73, ST131 (rUTI). Our isolates were occasionally resistant to antibiotics used in the clinic, with ST131 strain (asymptomatic woman) showing the highest resistance rate (6 antibiotics from 4 classes). Phylogenomics of ST131 and other analyzed lineages revealed close relatedness of genomes from healthy and diseased host and no phylogenetic distinction according to host health status. Our findings demonstrate that healthy urogenital microbiome is a source of potentially pathogenic E. coli strains, including lineages causing UTI e.g., ST131. A high prevalence of ExPEC clones, occasionally resistant to antibiotics should be of clinical concern and likely raises questions regarding etiology of UTI-associated clones.",

Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences are highly abundant among cellular RNA, but if the target sequences do not include polyadenylation, these cannot be easily removed in library preparation, requiring their post-hoc removal with computational techniques to accelerate and improve downstream analyses. Here we describe RiboDetector, a novel software based on a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network, which rapidly and accurately identifies rRNA reads from transcriptomic, metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, noncoding RNA, and ribosome profiling sequence data. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, Ribodetector can produce one order of magnitude fewer misclassifications. Importantly, the few false positives of RiboDetector on the benchmark dataset were not enriched in certain Gene Ontology (GO) terms, suggesting a low bias for downstream functional profiling. RiboDetector also demonstrated a remarkable generalization ability for detecting novel rRNA sequences divergent from the training data with sequence identities of less than 90%. On a personal computer, RiboDetector can process 40M reads in less than 6 minutes, which is about 50 times faster in GPU mode and about 15 times in CPU mode than other methods.\n\nRiboDetector is available under a GPL v3.0 license at https://github.com/hzi-bifo/RiboDetector.",

Large quantities of live LAB are consumed within fermented foods, but it is not yet known to what extent the LAB we ingest become members of the gut microbiome. By analysis of 9445 metagenomes from human samples, we demonstrate that the prevalence and abundance of LAB species in stool samples is generally low and linked to age, lifestyle, and geography, with Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis being most prevalent. Moreover, we identify genome-based differences between food and gut microbes by considering 666 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) newly reconstructed from fermented food microbiomes along with 154,723 human MAGs and 193,078 reference genomes. Our large-scale genome-wide analysis demonstrates that closely related LAB strains occur in both food and gut environments and provides unprecedented evidence that fermented foods can be indeed regarded as a possible source of LAB for the gut microbiome.\n\nlink to the OA-paper https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16438-8",

Neonates begin life sterile, but by one month virus-like particles are detectable in stool at a billion per gram. Multiple research strategies show that prophage induction provides a first wave of viral colonization. Viruses that grow on human cells appear later, and abundance of these viruses are negatively associated with breast feeding. Thus colonization of the gut of neonates appears to be step-wise, first by prophages induced from pioneer bacteria, and secondly by viruses infecting human cells, which is inhibited by breastfeeding. The second reports on studies of the virome dark matter, and the identification a new family of human-associated oro respiratory viruses recovered from the viral dark matter, named Redondoviruses.",

                            "abstract": "Characterization of microbial community viability is of great importance: essentially all sequence-based technologies do not differentiate living from dead microbes, whereas the functions and phenotypes of microbial communities are defined by biochemically active (\u201cviable\u201d) organisms. As a result, our understanding of microbial community structures and their potential transmission mechanisms remains incomplete. As a potential solution to this issue, 16S RNA-based amplicon sequencing (not rRNA gene, but the rRNA transcripts) has been proposed as a method to quantify the viable fraction of a microbial community, but its reliability has not been evaluated systematically. Here, we present our work to benchmark 16S-RNA-seq (targeting 16S rRNA transcripts and genes for parallel RNA and DNA sequencing) for viability assessment in synthetic and realistic microbial communities. In synthetic communities, we found that 16S-RNA-seq successfully reconstructed the mixtures of heat-killed Escherichia coli and Streptococcus sanguinis. We then applied this technique to natural communities (computer screens and mice, soil, and saliva) spiked with known concentrations of living and heat-killed E. coli to evaluate its performance in realistic conditions. No significant compositional differences were explained by the 16S-RNA assessment, suggesting that 16S-RNA-seq is not appropriate for viability assessment in complex communities. Results were slightly different when evaluated in environmental samples of similar origins (i.e. from Boston subway systems), samples were differentiated both by environments as well as by library type. Overall, these results show that 16S-RNA-seq has promise, but that previous literature assuming that 16S-rRNA amplicons are directly, quantitatively enriched for viable microbes is likely incorrect, as the technique does not reflect microbial viability outside of very simple, synthetic \u201ccommunities.\u201d We are currently continuing this work to develop new RNA amplicon-seq markers based on protein-encoding genes cpn60, as well as to improve viability assessment with multi-omic integration, e.g. combining amplicon-seq with functional indicators such as metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic profiles. These can circumvent some of the current limitations of 16S-RNA-seq, providing a complementary definition of viability, and directly observing activities such as virulence, pathogenicity, or antimicrobial resistance that are not captured by amplicon sequencing.",

                            "abstract": "Complex interactions between the gut microbiome and immune cells in infancy are thought to be part of the pathogenesis for the marked rise in pediatric allergic diseases, particularly food allergies. Food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) is commonly the earliest recognized non-IgE-mediated food allergy in infancy and is associated with atopic dermatitis and subsequent IgE-mediated food allergy later in childhood. Yet, a large prospective longitudinal study of the microbiome of infants with FPIAP (including samples prior to symptom onset) has not been done. Here we analyzed 954 longitudinal samples from 160 infants in a nested case-control study (81 who developed FPIAP, and 79 matched controls) from 1 week to 1 year of age by 16S rRNA ribosomal gene sequencing as part of the Gastrointestinal Microbiome and Allergic Proctocolitis (GMAP) Study. We confirmed that vaginally delivered infants had a greater abundance of Bacteroides, infants who received any breast milk had a greater abundance of Bifidobacterium, and that overall bacterial richness rose over the first year. We found key differences in the microbiome of infants with FPIAP, most strongly a higher abundance of a genus of Enterobacteriaceae and a lower abundance of a family of Clostridiales during the symptomatic period, as well as other key taxonomic differences across symptom states including prior to symptom onset. This study contributes to the larger body of literature examining structural development of the early life gut microbiome and provides a foundation for more mechanistic investigation into the pathogenesis and microbial effects on FPIAP and subsequent food allergic diseases in childhood.",

We present the first study evaluating gut microbiome composition of two transitioning South African populations using short- and long-read sequencing. We analyzed shotgun sequencing samples from adult females living in rural Bushbuckridge (n=117) or urban Soweto (n=51) and find that these microbiomes are intermediate between those of western populations and previously studied agriculturalist and hunter-gatherer African populations. We found that widely used reference collections are incomplete for nonwestern microbiomes, resulting in a larger portion of unclassified sequencing in transitional and nonwestern populations and within-cohort beta diversity patterns that are reversed compared to reference-agnostic sequence comparison patterns. To improve reference databases, we performed de novo metagenomic assembly of long-read sequencing data to generate complete genomes of undescribed taxa, including Treponema and Lentisphaerae species. Collectively, our results suggest that South Africa\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s transitional lifestyle and epidemiological conditions are reflected in gut microbiota compositions, and that these populations contain microbial diversity that remains to be described. This work underscores the critical need to broaden the scope of human gut microbiome research and include understudied, nonwestern populations to improve the relevance and accuracy of microbiome discoveries to broader populations.",

How host environment drives microbial evolution was studied in some bacterial species, however, some studies concluded long-term purifying selection while others demonstrated evidence of adaptation. To address this problem, we broadly investigated the within-person evolution of 64 gut commensal species in healthy subjects. We found that most (24 of 27) species with sufficient genetic variation underwent recent adaptation, evidenced by parallel evolution (PE). This finding was supported by three lines of evidence on PE mutations (significantly more than expected, significantly higher dN/dS, significant enrichment of truncations). Moreover, signal transduction pathways underwent the strongest and most widespread positive selection. One striking example is an HTH-type transcriptional regulator (msmR) regulating carbohydrate transportation that underwent widespread PE in six species across 28 people, potentially driven by host diet changes. We resolved the previous debate of gut microbiota evolution showing widespread within-host adaptation, and identified adaptive mutations to guide precise microbiome manipulations.",

                            "abstract": "There are hundreds of millions of survivors of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and this group continues to grow. Sars-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is detectable in gastrointestinal secretions with measurable impact on the gut microbiome. Given reports that COVID-19 causes persistent symptoms in a majority of COVID survivors, we sought to understand the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the gut microbiome. We longitudinally sampled 18 individuals (n = 14 COVID positive and n = 4 COVID-19 negative household contacts) living in San Francisco. Consistent with prior reports, we detect an association between COVID-19 and the gut microbiome. COVID-19 survivors exhibited greater dispersion of the microbial community. COVID-19 survivors gut microbial communities were more self-distinct when compared to COVID-19 negative individuals. Population level social distancing practices varied during the time of sample collection in our cohort, and we found an unexpected association between population level social distancing and gut microbial community variation. Alpha diversity varied overtime in COVID-19 negative individuals. In contrast alpha diversity over time mirrored the effects observed in beta-dispersion in this group in COVID-19 positive individuals. We analyzed a separate cohort of healthy San Franciscans pre-pandemic where we observed similar variation in alpha diversity over time. We conclude that COVID-19 survivors exhibit greater dispersion of their microbial communities, which is a perturbation observable months after infection and potentially compounded by population level social distancing practices.",

Recent hypotheses of how meconium microbiota communities are formed include initial colonization during gestation and further influence by delivery mode and other perinatal factors including maternal health. We examined reports of differentially abundant meconium microbiota and alpha diversity by delivery mode (vaginal versus C-section) for newborns of healthy women. Ten articles met criteria for inclusion, representing 601 vaginal deliveries and 281 C-sections. Reported signatures were standardized using the NCBI taxonomy, and reports of differential alpha diversity were recorded. The only concordance in differential abundance signatures was in the genus Stenotrophomonas, reported in two of 10 studies as overabundant in the meconium of C-section delivery newborns when compared to newborns of vaginal delivery, and Enterococcus, reported in two of 10 studies as less abundant. In conclusion, little consistency is seen in published results on over or under abundance of meconium microbiota by delivery mode. Mode of delivery may play a role in the meconium microbiota; however, low replicability across studies limits conclusions that can be drawn about the contribution of mode of delivery to the infant gut microbiome. Future microbiome studies of low microbial biomass meconium should take extra measures to avoid sample contamination, employ negative controls to assess the effectiveness of these measures, set clearly defined inclusion and exclusion criteria for consistency with previous studies (particularly for antibiotics usage and gestational age), and have larger sample sizes.",

                            "abstract": "The emergence of resistance to biocides is a critical concern in healthcare settings, severely limiting our ability to prevent infection. Chlorhexidine is one of the most widely used disinfectants in the medical intensive care units (MICU) since the 1950s . It is usually applied onto the skin of the patients and health care providers and acts against a wide range of bacteria by disrupting the cell membrane of the bacterial cell wall. However, studies have shown that the exposure to sub-lethal chlorhexidine concentrations may enhance resistance in species well known for emerging antibiotic resistance . To understand the genomic diversity of chlorhexidine tolerance in a high-priority environment, we surveyed an MICU for cultivable organisms demonstrating chlorhexidine resistance and performed whole genome sequencing on selected isolates. We collected 219 swab samples from different locations (e.g. nurse calls, keyboards, bed rails, etc) over two sampling events. The samples were then subjected to cultivation, morphological characterization and selective media screening, resulting in 1415 isolates, of which 308 isolates (21.8%) were able to grow on agar containing 18.75 \u00b5g/mL chlorhexidine digluconate. We take a comparative genomics approach to identifying genes related to chlorhexidine resistance by comparing genomes of the same species with different chlorhexidine susceptibility. Future work will focus on testing cross-resistance between chlorhexidine and clinically relevant antibiotics in the collected isolates. As the hospital microbiome can serve as a source of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, contributing to hospital-acquired infections, the genetic characterization of chlorhexidine-resistant organisms at environmental locations within the MICU has important implications for disinfection and patient safety, as well as advancing our basic understanding of resistance to this widely used disinfectant.",

In the infant gut these bacteria encounter a new metabolic environment that differs from the adult gut, potentially requiring adjustments in their activities. We used community RNA sequencing data (metatranscriptomes) from ten mother-infant dyads participating in the NiPPeR Study to characterize bacterial gene expression shifts following mother-to-infant transmission. Maternally-derived bacterial strains exhibited large scale gene expression shifts following the transmission to the infant gut, with 12,564 activated and 14,844 deactivated gene families. The implicated genes were most numerous and the magnitude shifts greatest in Bacteroides spp. and included genes involved in, for example, carbohydrate utilisation and lysogenic phage activity. Community functions were contrastingly different between mothers and infants on DNA, but not on RNA level; this suggests that bacteria compensated for variations in DNA gene abundance by collectively adjusting gene expression to maintain diverse and stable community activity profiles. Collectively, these data demonstrate environment-dependent, strain-specific shifts in gut bacteria function and underscores the importance of metatranscriptomic analysis in microbiome studies.",

To prepare for a large-scale study on the female microbiome by remote self-sampling, we investigated the impact of sample collection, storage, and host DNA depletion on microbiome profiling. Vaginal, skin, and saliva samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon and metagenomic shotgun sequencing, and qPCR. Of the two tested storage buffers, the eNAT buffer could keep the microbial composition stable during various conditions. All three tested host DNA-depletion approaches showed a bias against Gram-negative taxa. However, using the Host- ZERO Microbial DNA and QIAamp DNA Microbiome kits, samples still clustered according to body site and not by depletion approach. Therefore, our study showed the effectiveness of these methods in depleting host DNA. Yet, a suitable approach is recommended for each habitat studied based on microbial composition.",

                            "abstract": "Although our understanding of the importance of the gut microbiota-brain axis in health and disease has increased dramatically over the last decade, our knowledge of the signalling systems that underlie this communication lags behind. Strong evidence points to a role for the various microbial metabolites found in the host circulation and their actions at the principal interface of the brain and the periphery, the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is produced by hepatic oxidation of its gut microbe-derived precursor trimethylamine (TMA) and has been associated with a number of cardiovascular disorders in population-level studies, although its effect(s) on the brain have received less attention. We investigated whether TMAO could modulate the cerebral vasculature and what implications this might have for cognition. We show that physiologically relevant concentrations of TMAO enhance and protect BBB integrity in vitro, acting by mobilisation of the inter-endothelial tight junction regulator annexin A1, while in contrast, TMA impaired BBB function and disrupted tight junction integrity. Notably, beneficial effects of TMAO were replicated in vivo, with its administration reversing BBB impairment induced by either acute or chronic administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This protective effect was consequential for brain function, with long-term TMAO administration via the drinking water preventing LPS-induced recognition memory impairment. Further examination revealed that TMAO prevented LPS-induced glial activation in the entorhinal cortex, a key area for recognition memory. Together, these data identify TMAO as a significant actor in the gut-brain axis, and indicate beneficial effects upon both the brain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defensive systems and cognitive function \u00e2\u20ac\u201c emphasising the importance of dose in studying microbial metabolites. This broadens the range of mediators involved in gut microbe-brain communication, and reinforces the BBB as a significant interface in this axis. As circulating TMAO is ultimately derived from dietary choline, these changes may help explain the well-known beneficial effects of consumption of a seafood-rich diet upon the brain and could have implications for neurological conditions such as dementia.",

Mucositis and peri-implantitis are common microbial-biofilm-associated diseases affecting the tissues that surround the dental implant and are a major medical and socioeconomic burden. By metagenomic sequencing of the plaque microbiome in different peri-implant health and disease conditions (113 samples from 72 individuals), we found microbial signatures for peri-implantitis and mucositis and defined the peri-implantitis-related complex (PiRC) composed by the 7 most discriminative bacteria. The peri-implantitis microbiome is site specific as contralateral healthy sites resembled more the microbiome of healthy implants, while mucositis was specifically enriched for Fusobacterium nucleatum acting as a keystone colonizer. Microbiome-based machine learning showed high diagnostic and prognostic power for peri-implant diseases and strain-level profiling identified a previously uncharacterized subspecies of F. nucleatum to be particularly associated with disease. Altogether, we associated the plaque microbiome with peri-implant diseases and identified microbial signatures of disease severity. \n\nLink to the OA paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41522-020-00155-7",

Commonly used reporting guidelines for observational or genetic epidemiology studies lack key features specific to microbiome studies. Therefore, a multidisciplinary group of microbiome epidemiology researchers adapted guidelines for observational and genetic studies to culture-independent human microbiome studies, and also developed new reporting elements for laboratory, bioinformatics and statistical analyses tailored to microbiome studies. The resulting tool, called Strengthening The Organization and Reporting of Microbiome Studies (STORMS), is composed of a 17-item checklist organized into six sections that correspond to the typical sections of a scientific publication, presented as an editable table for inclusion in supplementary materials. The STORMS checklist provides guidance for concise and complete reporting of microbiome studies that will facilitate manuscript preparation, peer review, and reader comprehension of publications and comparative analysis of published results. \n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01552-x",

                            "abstract": "Background: The human intestinal microbiome is a complex community that contributes to host health and disease. In addition to normal microbiota, pathogens like carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae may be asymptomatically present. When these bacteria are present at very low levels, they are often undetectable in hospital surveillance cultures, known as occult or subclinical colonization. Through the use of antibiotics, these subclinical pathogens can increase to sufficiently high levels to become detectable, in a process called outgrowth. However, little is known about the interaction between gut microbiota and Enterobacteriaceae during occult colonization and outgrowth. Results: We developed a clinically-relevant mouse model for studying occult colonization. Conventional wild-type mice without antibiotic pre-treatment were exposed to K. pneumoniae but rapidly tested negative for colonization. This occult colonization was found to perturb the microbiome as detected by both 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Outgrowth of occult K. pneumoniae was induced either by a four-antibiotic cocktail or by individual receipt of ampicillin, vancomycin or azithromycin, which all reduced overall microbial diversity. Notably, vancomycin was shown to trigger K. pneumoniae outgrowth in only a subset of exposed animals (outgrowth-susceptible). To identify factors that underlie outgrowth susceptibility, we analyzed microbiome-encoded gene functions and were able to classify outgrowth-susceptible microbiomes using pathways associated with mRNA stability. Lastly, an evolutionary approach illuminated the importance of xylose metabolism in K. pneumoniae colonization, supporting xylose abundance as a second susceptibility indicator. We showed that our model is generalizable to other pathogens, including carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Conclusions: Our modeling of occult colonization and outgrowth could help the development of strategies to mitigate the risk of subsequent infection and transmission in medical facilities and the wider community. This study suggests that microbiota mRNA and small-molecule metabolites may be used to predict outgrowth-susceptibility. \n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.24.432587v1",

                            "abstract": "Although the composition and functional potential of the human gut microbiota evolve over the lifespan, kinship has been identified as a key covariate of microbial community diversification. However, to date, sharing of microbiota features within families has mostly been assessed between parents and their direct offspring. Here we investigate the potential transmission and persistence of familial microbiome patterns and microbial genotypes in a family cohort (n\u2009=\u2009102) spanning 3 to 5 generations over the same female bloodline. We observe microbiome community composition associated with kinship, with seven low abundant genera displaying familial distribution patterns. While kinship and current cohabitation emerge as closely entangled variables, our explorative analyses of microbial genotype distribution and transmission estimates point at the latter as a key covariate of strain dissemination. Highest potential transmission rates are estimated between sisters and mother\u2013daughter pairs, decreasing with increasing daughter\u2019s age and being higher among cohabiting pairs than those living apart. Although rare, we detect potential transmission events spanning three and four generations, primarily involving species of the genera Alistipes and Bacteroides. Overall, while our analyses confirm the existence of family-bound microbiome community profiles, transmission or co-acquisition of bacterial strains appears to be strongly linked to cohabitation. \n\nLink to the OA paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-01021-8",

In both cases, these entities are defined after the data are collected, thus imposing a nonparametric framework. There are usually more features-rows than columns imposing necessary regularization through use of Bayesian priors.\n\nHowever, the classical Dirichlet-multinomial models are insufficient to account for the strong associations (or exclusions) between certain bacteria, thus recent hierarchical models such as latent Dirichlet topic models have provided a more flexible framework that allow mixed membership models more appropriate for these non-Gaussian data.\n\nWe will show how these hierarchical topic models can enhance our understanding of both longitudinal dependencies between samples and biological dependencies between taxa, regardless of the differences in sampling depth and sources of variability.\nThis contains work with Kris Sankaran, Pratheepa Jeganathan, Laura Symul, Ben Callahan, and David Relman.",

We performed a large autism stool metagenomics study (n = 247) based on participants from the Australian Autism Biobank and the Queensland Twin Adolescent Brain project. We found negligible direct associations between ASD diagnosis and the gut microbiome. Instead, our data support a model whereby ASD-related restricted interests are associated with less-diverse diet, and in turn reduced microbial taxonomic diversity and looser stool consistency. In contrast to ASD diagnosis, our dataset was well powered to detect microbiome associations with traits such as age, dietary intake, and stool consistency. Overall, microbiome differences in ASD may reflect dietary preferences that relate to diagnostic features, and we caution against claims that the microbiome has a driving role in ASD.",

While external sources of contamination such as DNA extraction kits have been widely reported and investigated, contamination originating within the study itself remains underreported. Here we applied high-resolution strain-resolved analyses to identify contamination in two large-scale clinical metagenomics datasets. By mapping strain sharing to DNA extraction plates, we identified well-to-well contamination in both negative controls and biological samples in one dataset. Such contamination is more likely to occur among samples that are on the same or adjacent columns or rows of the extraction plate than samples that are far apart. Our strain-resolved workflow also reveals the presence of externally derived contamination, primarily in the other dataset. Overall in both datasets, contamination is more significant in samples with lower biomass. Our work demonstrates that genome-resolved strain tracking, with its essentially genome-wide nucleotide-level resolution, can be used to detect contamination in sequencing-based microbiome studies. Our results underscore the value of strain-specific methods to detect contamination and the critical importance of looking for contamination beyond negative and positive controls.",

This broad view of plasmid diversity revealed 1,169 \u2018plasmid systems\u2019, an evolutionary phenomenon where a backbone sequence with core plasmid functions, such as replication, is recombined with cargo functions, such as antibiotic resistance, depending on the environment.

Here, we show in rodent models that long-term consumption of a processed diet drives intestinal barrier permeability and an increased risk of CKD. Inhibition of the advanced glycation pathway, which generates Maillard reaction products within foods upon thermal processing, reversed kidney injury. Consequently, a processed diet leads to innate immune complement activation and local kidney inflammation and injury via the potent proinflammatory effector molecule complement 5a (C5a). In a mouse model of diabetes, a high resistant starch fiber diet maintained gut barrier integrity and decreased severity of kidney injury via suppression of complement. These results demonstrate mechanisms by which processed foods cause inflammation that leads to chronic disease.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abe4841",

Nevertheless, some gut taxa have been reported to disseminate to systemic tissues. However, the extent to which this normally occurs during homeostasis in healthy organisms is still unknown. In this study, we recovered viable gut bacteria from systemic tissues of healthy wild type (WT) and MyD88\u2212/\u2212 mice. Shotgun metagenomic-sequencing revealed a marked increase in the relative abundance of L. johnsonii in intestinal tissues of MyD88\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to WT mice. Lactobacillus johnsonii was detected most frequently from multiple systemic tissues and at higher levels in MyD88\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to WT mice. Viable L. johnsonii strains were recovered from different cell types sorted from intestinal and systemic tissues of WT and MyD88\u2212/\u2212 mice. L. johnsonii could persist in dendritic cells and may represent murine immunomodulatory endosymbionts.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2021.2007743",

Contrarily, the effect of HMs on microbial alpha-diversity remains an open question. Literature is contrasting, most likely because the microbial alpha-diversity variations strongly depend on heterogeneous and study-specific experimental conditions (e.g. soil type, soil chemical, physical and biological characteristics, type of metal considered, dose added etc.). Here, we report the first meta-analysis upon the response of soil microbial alpha-diversity to the experimental addition of cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu). We considered the studies using the DNA metabarcoding of bacterial and fungal communities conducted between 2013 and 2021 to overcome some limitations of other techniques such as Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE), or cultivation. This resulted in 66 independent experiments reported in 32 primary papers located over four continents. We found dose-dependent response to HMs for microbial alpha-diversity in bulk soil, rhizosphere soil and sediments. We further estimated that, on average, 17.5 mg kg-1 was the minimum inhibitory dose necessary to register a first significant loss (0.03 %) in microbial alpha-diversity compared to control conditions. However, such decline in alpha-diversity reached a maximum of 14.3 % for HMs additions peaking 5000 mg kg-1, irrespectively of the different experimental conditions. Our results suggest that extreme doses of Cu and Cd are necessary to have a consistent diversity loss, highlighting how the behaviour of microbial communities diverges from macro-organisms.",

                            "abstract": "Boosted by the exponential growth of microbiome-based studies, analyzing microbiome patterns is now a hot-topic, finding different fields of application. In particular, the use of machine learning techniques is increasing in microbiome studies, providing deep insights into microbial community composition. In this context, in order to investigate microbial patterns from 16S rRNA metabarcoding data, we explored the effectiveness of Association Rule Mining (ARM) technique, a supervised-machine learning procedure, to extract patterns (in this work, intended as groups of species or taxa) from microbiome data. ARM can generate huge amounts of data, making spurious information removal and visualizing results challenging. Our work sheds light on the strengths and weaknesses of pattern mining strategy into the study of microbial patterns, in particular from 16S rRNA microbiome datasets, applying ARM on real case studies and providing guidelines for future usage. Our results highlighted issues related to the type of input and the use of metadata in microbial pattern extraction, identifying the key steps that must be considered to apply ARM consciously on 16S rRNA microbiome data. To promote the use of ARM and the visualization of microbiome patterns, specifically, we developed microFIM (microbial Frequent Itemset Mining), a versatile Python tool that facilitates the use of ARM integrating common microbiome outputs, such as taxa tables. microFIM implements interest measures to remove spurious information and merges the results of ARM analysis with the common microbiome outputs, providing similar microbiome strategies that help scientists to integrate ARM in microbiome applications. With this work, we aimed at creating a bridge between microbial ecology researchers and ARM technique, making researchers aware about the strength and weaknesses of association rule mining approach.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbinf.2021.794547/full",

However, many available tools to process this data require both bioinformatics skills and high computational power to process big datasets. Furthermore, there are only few tools that allow for long read amplicon data analysis. To bridge this gap, we developed the LotuS2 (Less OTU Scripts 2) pipeline, enabling user-friendly, resource friendly, and versatile analysis of raw amplicon sequences. In LotuS2, six different sequence clustering algorithms as well as extensive pre- and post-processing options allow for flexible data analysis by both experts, where parameters can be fully adjusted, and novices, where defaults are provided for different scenarios. We benchmarked three independent gut and soil datasets, where LotuS2 was on average 29 times faster compared to other pipelines \u2013 yet could better reproduce the alpha- and beta-diversity of technical replicate samples. Further benchmarking a mock community with known taxa composition showed that, compared to the other pipelines, LotuS2 recovered a higher fraction of correctly identified genera and species (98% and 57%, respectively). At ASV/OTU level, precision and F-score were highest for LotuS2, as was the fraction of correctly reconstructed 16S sequences. In conclusion, LotuS2 is a lightweight and user-friendly pipeline that is fast, precise and streamlined. High data usage rates and reliability enable high-throughput microbiome analysis in minutes.",

Here, we investigate whether host anatomy can explain strain co-residence of Cutibacterium acnes, the most abundant species on human skin. We reconstruct on-person evolution and migration using whole-genome sequencing of C. acnes colonies acquired from healthy subjects, including from individual skin pores, and find considerable spatial structure at the level of pores. Although lineages (sets of colonies separated by less than 100 mutations) with in vitro fitness differences coexist within centimeter-scale regions, each pore is dominated by a single lineage. Moreover, colonies from a pore typically have identical genomes. An absence of adaptive signatures suggests a genotype-independent source of low within-pore diversity. We therefore propose that pore anatomy imposes random single-cell bottlenecks; the resulting population fragmentation reduces competition and promotes coexistence. Our findings suggest that therapeutic interventions involving pore-dwelling species might focus on removing resident populations over optimizing probiotic fitness.",

                            "abstract": "Microbiota transplantation studies in chickens represent a fascinating opportunity to study the impact of early-life microbiota manipulation on important phenotypes such as pathogen resistance and nutrition. When chicks are raised by a maternal hen, they quickly develop a gastrointestinal microbiota that is similar to their mother. However, commercially-raised chicks have no direct contact with maternal hens or their faeces. They subsequently develop a less-diverse microbiota that is seeded from their environment. By delivering microbiota transplants from chickens with a desired phenotype to chicks raised without maternal contact we can define the trajectory of their microbiota development. This allows us to examine the impact of the transplanted microbiota on the development of desired phenotypes. However, studies have shown varying success when attempting to conduct microbiota transplants in chickens, potentially due to the variability of techniques used. We investigated whether it was possible to transplant the caecal microbiota between 40 week old adult chickens and freshly hatched chicks from a different chicken breed. Caecal contents were collected from the adult birds and within 30 minutes were administered orally to chicks. The microbiota of treated and control chicks was characterised via 16S rRNA gene sequencing at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 days post-hatch. At all timepoints, the microbiota of treated chicks was significantly different in composition and richer and more diverse than control birds. Transplantation clearly changed the trajectory of the treated birds so that they developed a microbiota which was far more similar to the donor birds than the control chicks. The most notable taxonomic difference between control and treated birds was the abundance of the phylum Bacteroidota. This phylum was present in high relative abundance in the donor samples (38%) and also in the treated samples (day 7: 41%). However, it was almost completely absent from the control birds (Day7: 0.02%). We therefore demonstrate that our technique is highly effective at transplanting the caecal microbiota between adult donors and chicks from a different chicken breed. This technique could be further used to study the role of the microbiota in chicken breeds with differing phenotypes. \n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579121006453",

                            "abstract": "Drinking water quality and safety is strictly regulated and constantly monitored, but little is known about the microorganisms inhabiting drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs). This lack of knowledge prevents optimization of designs and operational controls. Here we investigated the drinking water microbial community harbored by a groundwater-derived DWTP, involving mineral and vegetal granular activated carbon filters (GACs). We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to analyze water microbiome variations through the potabilization process, considering (i) different GAC materials and (ii) time from GAC regeneration. Our results revealed the predominance of Cand. Patescibacteria, uncultivable bacteria with limited metabolic capacities and small genomes, from source to downstream water. Microbial communities clustered per sampling date, with the noteworthy exception of groundwater samples. If the groundwater microbiome showed no significant variations over time, the community structure of water downstream GACs (both mineral and vegetal) seemed to be affected by time from GAC regeneration. Looking at a finer scale, different GAC material affected microbiome assembly over time with significant variation in the relative abundances of specific taxa. The significance of our research is in identifying the environmental microorganisms intrinsic of deep groundwater and the community shift after the perturbations induced by potabilization processes. Which microorganisms colonize different GACs and become abundant after GACs regeneration and over time is a first step toward advanced control of microbial communities, improving drinking water safety and management of operational costs.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.615513/full",

                            "abstract": "Objective To investigate whether axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA) patients have an altered immunoglobulin A (IgA) response in the gut and oral microbial communities. Methods We performed 16S rRNA gene (16S) sequencing on IgA positive (IgA+) and IgA negative (IgA\u2212) fractions (IgA-SEQ) from feces (n=17 AxSpA; n=14 healthy) and saliva (n=17 AxSpA; n=12 healthy), as well as on IgA-unsorted fecal and salivary samples. PICRUSt2 was used to predict microbial metabolic potential in AxSpA patients and healthy controls (HCs). Results IgA-SEQ revealed enrichment of several microbes in the fecal (Akkermansia, Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospira) and salivary (Prevotellaceae, Actinobacillus) microbiome in AxSpA patients as compared with HCs. Fecal microbiome from AxSpA patients showed a trend towards increased alpha diversity of the IgA+ fraction and decreased diversity in the IgA\u2212 fraction in comparison with HCs, while the salivary microbiome exhibits a significant decrease in alpha diversity in both IgA+ and IgA\u2212 fractions. Increased IgA coating of Clostridiales Family XIII correlated with disease severity. Inferred metagenomic analysis suggests perturbation of metabolites and metabolic pathways for inflammation (oxidative phosphorylation, glutathione metabolism) and metabolism (propanoate and butanoate metabolism) in AxSpA patients. Conclusions Analyses of fecal and salivary microbes from AxSpA patients reveal distinct populations of immunoreactive microbes using novel IgA-SEQ approach, which were not captured by comparing their relative abundance with HCs. Predictive metagenomic analysis revealed perturbation of metabolites/metabolic pathways in AxSpA patients. Future studies on these immunoreactive microbes may lead to better understanding of the functional role of IgA in maintaining microbial structure and human health.",

Secondly, I will discuss how anthropogenic stressors can disturb the microbiome (i.e. cause dysbiosis) resulting in the proliferation of opportunistic pathogens leading to disease.

                            "abstract": "Transplantation of faecal microbiota (FMT) from healthy lean donors has been shown to transiently improve insulin sensitivity and alter fat distribution in individuals with obesity and metabolic syndrome. However, the mechanisms and levels of donor strain engraftment required to elicit these effects remain poorly characterised. To address this, we performed a double-blinded randomised placebo-controlled trial for FMT in 87 adolescents with obesity. Participants were randomized to receive multi-donor FMT (capsules containing the fecal microbiota of four healthy, lean, sex-matched donors) or placebo (saline capsules). Following a bowel cleanse, participants ingested a total of 28 capsules over two consecutive days. FMT capsules and recipient stool samples collected at baseline, 6-, 12- and 26-weeks post-treatment were analysed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing allowing us to track donor strain engraftment and monitor changes in the recipient gut microbiome over time. We found that multi-donor FMT sustainably altered the structure and functional potential of the gut microbiome for up to six months. In what was effectively a microbiome competition experiment, we discovered that two donor microbiomes (one female, one male) dominated strain engraftment. These \u2018super-donor\u2019 microbiomes were characterized by high microbial diversity and a high Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio. Engrafted strains led to enterotype-level shifts in community composition and provided genes that altered the metabolic potential of the microbiome, including pathways previously shown to be important in energy balance homeostasis (e.g. NAD biosynthesis). Despite our attempts to standardize FMT dose and donors, FMT recipients varied widely in their engraftment of donor strains suggesting the host environment plays a critical role in mediating FMT receptivity. Further work is required to better understand the various host-microbe interactions that determine engraftment success to help in developing more effective and personalised microbial therapies.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-021-01060-7",

                            "abstract": "With the recent explosion of next-generation sequencing and OMICS studies of human microbiome communities, a surprisingly broad diversity of diseases have been found to correlate with mucosal dysbiosis. Another consequence of such studies is an exponential increase in the number of uncharacterized and understudied microbes identified as potential drivers of mucosal health and disease. Thus, there is an impending challenge looming on the horizon to reveal the molecular basis for these observations. To meet this challenge, many newly identified microbes will require the development of new genetic systems useful for interrogating experimental models. Our laboratory has devoted a significant effort to improve the genetic tractability of a variety of important understudied microbiome species, especially those that have been traditionally considered as \u201cgenetically intractable\u201d. Here, we will discuss a recently developed genetic system for one such pathobiont species, Parvimonas micra. Our preferred approach to develop new genetic systems begins with identifying and exploiting endogenous natural competence abilities (i.e. energy-dependent exogenous DNA uptake). Accordingly, we identified a natural competence ability in P. micra, which allowed us to employ cloning-independent methodologies to construct a variety of targeted genetic mutations directly within low-passage clinical isolates. In addition, we successfully developed a luciferase-based reporter system, a theophylline-inducible gene expression system, and a Mariner transposon mutagenesis system for Tn-seq studies of P. micra. While natural competence is widely believed to be a specialized ability of a small number of prokaryotes, we have reason to believe that it is likely to be quite common among bacteria. As such, natural competence could provide a clear path to investigate the genetics of the numerous novel organisms identified from microbiome studies.",

We also explored gut microbiota composition across disorders in an attempt to elucidate potential commonalities in the microbial signatures associated with these mental disorders. Following the PRISMA guidelines, databases were searched from inception through to December 2021. We identified 44 studies (including a total of 2510 psychiatric cases and 2407 controls) that met inclusion criteria, of which 24 investigated gut microbiota composition in MDD, seven investigated gut microbiota composition in BD, and 15 investigated gut microbiota composition in SZ. Our syntheses provide no strong evidence for a difference in the number or distribution (\u03b1-diversity) of bacteria in those with a mental disorder compared to controls. However, studies were relatively consistent in reporting differences in overall community composition (\u03b2-diversity) in people with and without mental disorders. Our syntheses also identified specific bacterial taxa commonly associated with mental disorders, including lower levels of bacterial genera that produce short-chain fatty acids (e.g. butyrate), higher levels of lactic acid- producing bacteria, and higher levels of bacteria associated with glutamate and GABA metabolism. We also observed substantial heterogeneity across studies with regards to methodologies and reporting. Further prospective and experimental research using new tools and robust guidelines hold promise for improving our understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in mental and brain health and the development of interventions based on modification of gut microbiota.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01456-3",

                            "abstract": "The human urinary microbiome is thought to affect the development and progression of urinary tract infections (UTI), particularly recurrent UTIs in aging women. To understand the possible interactions of urinary pathogens with commensal bacteria inhabiting the aging bladder, we conducted an initial functional assessment of a representative set of urinary lactobacilli that dominate this niche in pre- and postmenopausal women. We created a repository of urinary bladder bacteria isolated via Enhanced Quantitative Urinary Culture (EQUC) from healthy postmenopausal women, as well as those with culture-proven recurrent UTI diagnosis. This repository contains lactobacilli strains from eight different species. As many other lactobacilli are known to inhibit human pathogens, including typical uropathogens, we screened the urinary lactobacilli in our repository for their ability to inhibit model uropathogens in vitro. We observed that many urinary lactobacilli strongly inhibit model gram-negative pathogens Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae but demonstrate less inhibition of gram-positive pathogen Enterococcus faecalis. The observed inhibition is not specific to these model uropathogens and also affects clinical and multidrug-resistant isolates. Our preliminary analysis of inhibition mechanisms implicates pH as an important factor with additional cell-dependent inhibition mechanisms that differ amongst species and strains of urinary lactobacilli. Overall, our data show that urinary lactobacilli are broadly inhibiting uropathogen growth in vitro via a combination of different mechanisms. Nevertheless, simple measured inhibition level is not predictive of health outcomes in colonized patients, and species and strain level diversity of urinary lactobacilli is high.",

Here, we analysed 534 metagenomes from 10 publicly available CDI study populations. While we detected C. difficile in only 30% of CDI samples, multiple other toxigenic species capable of inducing CDI-like symptomatology were prevalent, raising concerns about CDI overdiagnosis. We further tracked C. difficile in 42,814 metagenomic samples from 253 public studies. We found that C. difficile prevalence, abundance and association with other bacterial species is age-dependent. In healthy adults, C. difficile is a rare taxon associated with an overall species richness reduction, while in healthy infants C. difficile is a common member of the gut microbiome and its presence is associated with a significant increase in species richness. More specifically, we identified a group of species co-occurring with C. difficile exclusively in healthy infants, enriched in obligate anaerobes and in species typically found in the gut microbiome of healthy adults. Overall, gut microbiome composition in presence of C. difficile in healthy infants is associated with multiple parameters linked to a healthy gut microbiome maturation towards an adult-like state. Our results suggest that C. difficile is a commensal in infants, and that its asymptomatic carriage is dependent on the surrounding microbial context.",

                            "abstract": "Background:\nMaternal high-fat (HF) diet has long-term deleterious effect on offspring\u2019s metabolic phenotype. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether maternal metformin (MT) administration ameliorates the negative effects of maternal HF diet on offspring and the role of gut microbiota and microbial bile acids (BAs) in it. \nMethods:\nAfter mating, the pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to HF diet (60% fat) or standard CHOW diet (11.8% fat) group, and some of the HF diet group rats were co-treated with MT via drinking water (300 mg/kg/day), resulting in three groups according to maternal diet and MT treatment during gestation and lactation. All offspring were weaned on CHOW diet. The intestinal tissues and colon content of offspring rats were collected. In addition, offspring\u2019s hypothalamus gene expression and BA content in plasma of adult male offspring was analyzed. \nResults:\nMaternal HF diet resulted in increased body weight and adipose depots, increased intestinal and hypothalamic inflammation, changed gene expression of intestinal tight junctions and hypothalamic appetite markers in both male and female offspring at weaning, which continued into adulthood. The effects of maternal HF diet on offspring were alleviated by maternal MT administration. Interestingly, offspring\u2019s microbiota composition in adulthood was profoundly influenced by maternal HF diet and MT administration. Furthermore, the plasma BA content was normalized by maternal MT administration in adult male offspring of HF-fed dams, and maternal MT administration significantly enriched the proportion of the beneficial Lactobacillus genera, which were negatively correlated with plasma unconjugated BA levels. \nConclusions:\nThis study demonstrated the beneficial effects of maternal MT administration on offspring\u2019s metabolic phenotype, focusing on the microbiota-BA-hypothalamus axis. The present study indicates that maternal MT administration could reshape the gut microbiota in adult offspring, normalize offspring\u2019s plasma BA levels and gene expression of hypothalamic appetite markers, which may contribute to the beneficial effects of maternal MT exposure on offspring\u2019s metabolic phenotype.",

                            "abstract": "Computational algorithms have become an essential component of microbiome research, with great efforts by the scientific community to raise standards on the development and distribution of code. Despite these efforts, sustainability and reproducibility are major issues since continued validation through software testing is still not a widely adopted practice. In the field of microbial bioinformatics, good software engineering practices are not yet widely adopted. Many microbial bioinformaticians start out as (micro)biologists and subsequently learn how to code. Without abundant formal training, a lot of education about good software engineering practices comes down to an exchange of information within the microbial bioinformatics community. Here, we report seven recommendations that help researchers implement software testing in microbial bioinformatics. These recommendations are: Establish software needs and testing goals; Use appropriate input test files; Use an easy-to-follow language format to implement testing; Try to automate testing; Test across multiple computational setups; and Encourage others to test your software. We propose collaborative software testing as an opportunity to continuously engage software users, developers, and students to unify scientific work across domains. As automated software testing remains underused in scientific software, our set of recommendations not only ensures appropriate effort can be invested into producing high quality and robust software but also increases engagement in its sustainability. We have developed these recommendations based on our experience from a collaborative hackathon organised prior to the American Society for Microbiology Next Generation Sequencing (ASM NGS) 2020 conference. We also present a repository hosting examples and guidelines for testing, available from https://github.com/microbinfie-hackathon2020/CSIS.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/mgen/10.1099/mgen.0.000790",

Identifying effector microorganisms that causally affect host phenotype and deciphering the underlying mechanisms have become foci of microbiome research and have begun to enable the development of microbiota-based therapeutics. Two complementary, reductionist approaches have commonly been used: the first starts with a specific phenotype (such as immune cell induction) and narrows down the microbiota to identify responsible effector bacteria, while the second starts with bacteria-derived molecules and metabolites and seeks to understand their effects on the human physiology. Together, these strategies provide the basis for the rational design of microbiota-targeted therapeutics to ameliorate specific diseases and conditions.",

Here, we investigated the effect of host genetic factors in shaping the bacterial species composition in the rumen by performing a genome-wide association study. Using a common set of 61,974 single-nucleotide polymorphisms found in cattle genomes (n\u2009=\u2009586) and corresponding rumen bacterial community composition, we identified operational taxonomic units (OTUs), Families and Phyla with high heritability. The top associations (1-Mb windows) were located on 7 chromosomes. These regions were associated with the rumen microbiota in multiple ways; some (chromosome 19; position 3.0\u20134.0 Mb) are associated with closely related taxa (Prevotellaceae, Paraprevotellaceae, and RF16), some (chromosome 27; position 3.0\u20134.0 Mb) are associated with distantly related taxa (Prevotellaceae, Fibrobacteraceae, RF16, RFP12, S24-7, Lentisphaerae, and Tenericutes) and others (chromosome 23; position 0.0\u20131.0) associated with both related and unrelated taxa. The annotated genes associated with identified genomic regions suggest the associations observed are directed toward selective absorption of volatile fatty acids from the rumen to increase energy availability to the host. This study demonstrates that host genetics affects rumen bacterial community composition.",

How such guild-level structure supports the gut microbiota to stably provide essential health-relevant functions to the host remains elusive. With high quality metagenome-assembled genomes as network nodes, here we identified a core microbiome signature made up of two robust competing guilds that together correlate with a wide range of host health conditions. Genomes in these two guilds kept their ecological relationship unchanged despite experiencing profound abundance changes during a 3-month high fiber intervention and 1-year follow-up in patients with type 2 diabetes. The genomes of one guild harbored more genes for plant polysaccharide degradation and butyrate production, while the other guild had more genes for virulence or antibiotic resistance. A Random Forest regression model showed that the abundance distributions of these genomes were associated with 41 out of 43 bio-clinical parameters in the study cohort. With these genomes as reference, Random Forest modeling successfully classified case and control of 8 chronic diseases in 12 independent metagenomic datasets from 1,816 participants across ethnicity and geography. This core microbiome signature49 may facilitate ecological management of chronic diseases.",

                            "abstract": "Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis (B. infantis) is a prevalent beneficial bacterium colonizing the human neonatal gut. Decreased abundance of B. infantis contributes to the development of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in children from the least developing countries. Therapeutic approaches for treating SAM involve using human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) as dietary additions (prebiotics) to stimulate the growth of B. infantis and confer multiple health benefits to malnourished children. However, the rational selection of HMO-based prebiotics is hampered by the incomplete knowledge of regulatory mechanisms governing HMO utilization in this bacterium. A bioinformatic regulon reconstruction approach used in this study implicated NagR, a transcription factor from the ROK family, as a negative global regulator of genomic loci encoding lacto-N-biose/galacto-N-biose (LNB/GNB), lacto-N-tetraose (LNT), and lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) utilization pathways in B. infantis. This conjecture was corroborated by transcriptome profiling upon nagR genetic inactivation and experimental assessment of binding of recombinant NagR to predicted DNA operators. The latter approach also implicated N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), a universal intermediate of LNT and LNnT catabolism, and its phosphorylated derivatives as plausible NagR effectors. The elucidated regulatory network appears optimally adapted to simultaneous utilization of multiple HMOs, providing a rationale to add HMO mixtures (rather than individual components) into infant formulas to restore B. infantis levels in malnourished children.",

                            "abstract": "Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are a family of glycans found in breastmilk with over 200 identified structures. Despite being the third-largest solid component in breastmilk, HMOs are indigestible by infants, and they serve as food for the infant gut bacteria. Most research thus far has focused on Bifidobacterium species that harbor many glycoside hydrolases (GHs) tailored to break the carbon bonds in HMO molecules. However, there are additional microbes in the infant gut, such as Bacteroides species, with increasing evidence that they, too, are able to break-down HMOs. To study the unbiased impact of breastfeeding on the infant gut microbiome, we need to investigate the underlying mechanisms of HMO utilization by all members of the infant gut. Here, we developed an optimized system for isolating Bacteroides strains from infant stool samples. We then examined the HMO utilization capacity of multiple Bacteroides isolates by performing growth curves on six common HMOs (2\u2019-FL, DFL, 3\u2019-SL, 6\u2019-SL, LNT, LNnT). Isolates often displayed similar growth characteristics on similarly-structured HMOs, like sialylated or fucosylated sugars. We identified variation in HMO utilization across multiple strains of the same species, and chose to focus here on a Bacteroides dorei isolate that was able to utilize the test HMOs. We performed RNA sequencing on B. dorei cultures, comparing the transcriptional profile in minimal media supplemented with glucose or HMOs. We showed that B. dorei employs an extensive metabolic response to HMOs. Surprisingly, there was no clear up-regulation for most GH families previously known to break-down HMOs, possibly because they were almost exclusively described in Bifidobacterium species. Instead, B. dorei exhibits a generalized response to HMOs, markedly up-regulating several shared GH families across all conditions. Within each GH family, B. dorei displays a consistent pattern of up-regulation of some genes with down-regulation of the others. This response pattern to HMOs has yet to be described in other commensals of the infant gut. Our work highlights the importance of expanding the HMO-microbiome studies beyond Bifidobacterium species, sheds light on the differences across Bacteroides strains in terms of HMO utilization, and paves the way to understanding the mechanisms enabling Bacteroides HMO utilization.",

Population-specific biases in genomic reference databases can further compound this problem. Leveraging advances in long-read and Hi-C technologies, we deeply characterized 109 gut microbiomes from three ethnicities in Singapore to comprehensively reconstruct 4,497 medium and high-quality metagenome assembled genomes, 1,708 of which were missing in short-read only analysis and with less than 28 N50 improvement. Species-level clustering identified 70 (less than 10% of total) novel gut species out of 685, improved reference genomes for 363 species (53% of total), and discovered 3,413 strains that are unique to these populations. Among the top 10 most abundant gut bacteria in our study, one of the species and less than 80% of all strains were not represented in existing databases. Annotation of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) uncovered more than 27,000 BGCs with a large fraction (36-88%) not represented in current databases, and with several unique clusters predicted to produce bacteriocins that could significantly alter microbiome community structure. These results reveal the significant uncharacterized gut microbial diversity in Southeast Asian populations and highlight the utility of hybrid metagenomic references for bioprospecting and disease-focused studies.",

Several clinical studies have shown that probiotics might affect brain activity and behaviour in healthy subjects and subjects with disturbed gut-brain axis signalling. In this double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover functional magnetic resonance imaging study, 22 healthy subjects (age 243 years, 6m/16f) underwent a probiotic intervention containing Bifidobacterium longum R0175, Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum R1012 (in total at least 3\u00d7109 CFU/day) and a placebo intervention in randomised order for 4 weeks each, separated by a 4-week washout period. The probiotic intervention resulted in significantly altered brain response patterns (brain activity and functional connectivity) towards an acute emotional challenge and an acute mental arithmetic stress task, without effects on subjective stress ratings or cortisol response. Also, alterations in non-evoked resting state functional connectivity were observed upon probiotic intervention. Autonomic nervous system function was not significantly affected, neither at rest nor during stress, by the probiotic intervention compared to the placebo. Also, cognitive performance (assessed by Stroop) was not affected by the probiotic intervention. Apart from effects on brain function, also psychological symptoms, such as depression symptoms and sleep patterns, were slightly affected, even if none of the subjects experienced mental dysfunction at baseline. Other ratings, such as anxiety, perceived health, quality of life and perceived workload were not affected. Similarly, the probiotic intervention did not affect perceived stress nor the cortisol awakening response in non-evoked situations. In terms of signalling molecules, serotonin showed slightly higher baseline-corrected serum concentrations after probiotics compared to placebo, while brain-derived neurotrophic factor concentrations were not affected. Also, markers of intestinal damage or systemic inflammation were not affected. No substantial effects on the gut microbiota composition were observed. The probiotic intervention evoked distinct changes in brain function and subtle changes in psychological symptoms even in a healthy study population. These results give promising hints that patients with a disturbed gut-brain axis function could benefit from probiotic intake.",

Interestingly, the core taxa of tomatoes were Snodgrasella and Gilliamella, genera typically associated with bumblebees. The same amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were found on reared bumblebees, indicating that bumblebees, present in the sampled greenhouses to pollinate flowers, had introduced and dispersed these bacteria in greenhouses. Overall, we found that 80% of plants contained bumblebee-associated taxa, and on these plants, bumblebee-associated reads accounted up to a quarter of reads on tomatoes and a tenth of reads on strawberries. Furthermore, predatory mites had been introduced for the control of spider mites. Their microbiome was composed of a diverse set of bacteria, which varied between batches ordered at different times. Still, identical ASVs were found on mites and crops and these belonged to the genera Sphingomonas, Staphylococcus, Methylobacterium and Pseudomonas. These new insights should now be further explored and utilized to diversify these ecosystems that are characterized by low diversity and abundancy of microbes.",

                            "abstract": "The cervicovaginal microbiome (CVM) plays a significant role in women\u2019s cervical health and disease. Microbial alterations at the species level and characteristic community state types (CST) have been associated with acquisition and persistence of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) infections that may result in progression of cervical lesions to malignancy. Current sequencing methods, especially most commonly used multiplex 16S rRNA gene sequencing, struggle to fully clarify these changes because they generally fail to provide sufficient taxonomic resolution to adequately perform species-level associative studies. To improve CVM species designation, we designed a novel sequencing tool targeting microbes at the species taxonomic rank and examined its potential for profiling the CVM. Results. We introduce an accessible and practical circular probe-based RNA sequencing (CiRNAseq) technology with the potential to profile and quantify the CVM. In vitro and in silico validations demonstrate that CiRNAseq can distinctively detect species in a mock mixed microbial environment, with the output data reflecting its ability to estimate microbes\u2019 abundance. Moreover, compared to 16S rRNA gene sequencing, CiRNAseq provides equivalent results but with improved sequencing sensitivity. Analyses of a cohort of cervical smears from hrHPV-negative women versus hrHPV-positive women with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia confirmed known differences in CST occurring in the CVM of women with hrHPV-induced lesions. The technique also revealed variations in microbial diversity and abundance in the CVM of hrHPV-positive women when compared to hrHPV-negative women. Conclusions. CiRNAseq is a promising tool for studying the interplay between the CVM and hrHPV in cervical carcinogenesis. This technology could provide a better understanding of cervicovaginal CST and microbial species during health and disease, prompting the discovery of biomarkers, additional to hrHPV, that can help detect high-grade cervical lesions.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-021-01204-z",

                            "abstract": "Following recent evidence suggesting a role for the microbiome in PDAC etiology and progression, we explored the fecal and salivary microbiota as potential diagnostic biomarkers. Design: We applied shotgun metagenomic and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to samples from a Spanish case-control study (N=136), including 57 cases, 50 controls, and 29 chronic pancreatitis patients in the discovery phase, and from a German case-control study (N=76), in the validation phase. Results: Fecal metagenomic classifiers performed much better than saliva-based ones and identified PDAC cases with an accuracy of up to 0.84 AUROC based on a set of 27 microbial species, with consistent accuracy across early and late disease stages. Performance further improved to up to 0.94 AUROC when we combined our microbiome-based predictions with serum levels of carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9, the only current non-invasive, FDA-approved, low specificity PDAC diagnostic biomarker. Furthermore, a microbiota-based classification model constrained to PDAC-enriched species was highly disease-specific when validated against 25 publicly available metagenomic study populations for various health conditions (N=5,792). Both microbiome-based models had a high prediction accuracy on an external German validation population (N=76). Several fecal PDAC marker species were detectable in pancreatic tumor and non-tumor tissue using 16S rRNA sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Conclusion: Taken together, our results indicate that non-invasive, robust and specific fecal microbiota-based screening for the early detection of PDAC is feasible.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://gut.bmj.com/content/71/7/1359",

                            "abstract": "The Aotearoa New Zealand takah\u0113 (Porphyrio hochstetteri), once thought to be extinct, is a nationally threatened flightless rail under intensive conservation management. While there has been previous research into disease-related microbes in takah\u0113, little is known about the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract. Given the importance of gut-associated microbes to herbivore nutrition and immunity, knowledge of these communities is likely to be of considerable conservation value. Here we examined the gut microbiotas of 57 takah\u0113 at eight separate locations across Aotearoa New Zealand. Faecal samples, taken as a proxy for the hindgut bacterial community, were subjected to 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing using Illumina MiSeq. Phylogenetic analysis of more than 2200 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) revealed nine main bacterial phyla (Acidobacteriota, Actinobacteriota, Bacteroidota, Campilobacterota, Firmicutes, Fusobacteriota, Planctomycetota, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobiota) that accounted for the majority of sequence reads. Location was a significant effect (p value lower than 0.001, 9999 permutations) that accounted for 32% of the observed microbiota variation. One ASV, classified as Lactobacillus aviarius, was present in all samples at an average relative abundance of 17% (SD = 23.20). There was strong evidence (p = 0.002) for a difference in the abundance of the genus Lactobacillus between locations. A common commensal bacterium previously described in takah\u0113, Campylobacter spp., was also detected in most faecal samples. Location plays a pivotal role in the observed variation among takah\u0113 gut bacterial communities and is potentially due to factors such as supplemental feeding and medical treatment experienced by birds housed in captivity at one of the eight sampled sites. These data present a first glimpse of the previously unexplored takah\u0113 gut microbiota and provide a baseline for future microbiological studies and conservation efforts.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://animalmicrobiome.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42523-021-00158-5#Abs1",

                            "abstract": "Accumulating evidence indicates that the gut microbiome and metabolites are associated with colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the influence of surgery for CRC treatment on the gut microbiome and metabolites and how it relates to CRC risk in postoperative CRC patients remain partially understood. Here, we collected 170 fecal samples from 85 CRC patients pre- and approximately 1 year postsurgery and performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing and capillary electrophoresis-time of flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS)-based metabolomics analyses to characterize alterations between pre- and postsurgery. We determined that the relative abundance of 114 species was altered postsurgery (P lower than 0.005). CRC-associated species, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, were decreased postsurgery. On the other hand, Clostridium scindens, carcinogenesis-associated deoxycholate (DCA)-producing species, and its biotransformed genes (bai operon) were increased postsurgery. The concentration of 60 fecal metabolites was also altered postsurgery (P lower than 0.005). Two bile acids, cholate and DCA, were increased postsurgery. We developed methods to estimate postoperative CRC risk based on the gut microbiome and metabolomic compositions using a random forest machine-learning algorithm that classifies large adenoma or early-stage CRC and healthy controls from publicly available data sets. We applied methods to preoperative samples and then compared the estimated CRC risk between the two groups according to the presence of large adenoma or tumors 5 years postsurgery (P lower than 0.05). Overall, our results show that the gut microbiome and metabolites dynamically change from pre- to postsurgery. In postoperative CRC patients, potential CRC risk derived from gut microbiome and metabolites still remains, which indicates the importance of follow-up assessments.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.00018-22",

If not addressed post-publication, papers containing incorrect or even falsified data could lead to wasted time and money spent by other researchers trying to reproduce those results. Several high-profile science misconduct cases have been described, but many more cases remain undetected. Elisabeth Bik is an image forensics detective with a microbiology background, who left her paid job in industry to search for and report biomedical articles that contain errors or data of concern. She has done a systematic scan of 20,000 papers in 40 journals and found that about 4% of these contained inappropriately duplicated images. In her talk she will discuss her career shift from working in academia and industry on microbiome research to her present work on inappropriately duplicated images and other examples of research misconduct. In addition, she will show how to report scientific papers of concern, and how journals and institutions handle such allegations.",

This is especially true since the decrease of sequencing cost has led to an explosion of the number of genomes in public repositories. Estimating the amount of contamination, i.e. the inclusion of unwanted DNA in genomic materials, of this deluge of data has become a field in itself, with numerous algorithms now available and an increasing rate of publication over the years. As newly released tools do not simply replace older ones, but have their own scope, it becomes difficult for scientists to efficiently determine which tool to use in their study. Recently, we have published an overview of the main characteristics and applicability of 18 algorithms dedicated to the estimation of genomic contamination. For instance, the conceptual differences between database-free tools and those associated with a reference database have an effect on detection sensitivity, as do the difference between genomewide and marker-based methods. Beyond this typology of tools, we present here a new analysis designed to compare algorithms on a large simulated dataset derived from empirical data. This protocol, dubbed CRACOT for CRitical Assessment of COntamination detection at multiple Taxonomic levels, reveals both under- and over-detection by even the most commonly used algorithms, with simulated contamination events ranging from inter-phylum to inter-species.",

It is estimated that up to 95% of the lung virome remains uncharacterised. Here, we aim to catalogue the virome associated with the human respiratory tract by reanalysing publicly available data using a newly-developed pipEline for Viral assEmbly and chaRactEriSaTion (EVEREST). Methods: Lung virome studies (n=85) utilising shotgun metagenomics and lung-attributed samples were gathered from public databases. Following manual curation (n=44), bioproject data was inputted into EVEREST (https://agudeloromero.github.io/EVEREST/), resulting in viral discovery and taxonomic classification of known and unknown viruses. Complete and high-quality contigs were further assessed for genomic characterisation. Results: From a singular bioproject (PRJEB32062), 182 viral contigs were captured and 14 were classified as complete/high-quality. Those contigs lengths ranged between 12-387 kilobases. Focusing on three of the complete/high-quality contigs, we discovered two novel prophages (Caudovirales), and a new bacteriophage (Siphoviridae). Additionally, putative protein coding sequence regions were scanned, which ranged between 50-67 proteins. Annotation analysis showed phage-associated proteins, including proteases, DNA binding proteins and tail sheath and tube proteins, among others. Conclusion: We identified known and novel viruses utilising publicly available lung metagenome studies. Knowledge gained in the pulmonary virome will facilitate additional understanding of the virus-host microbiome interaction. We are in the process of expanding the EVEREST pipeline to other uncharacterised human niches.

Cervicovaginal microbes have been grouped into five community state types (CSTs) based on microbial community composition and abundance. However, studying the impact of CSTs in health and disease is challenging because the current sequencing technologies have limited confident discrimination between closely related and yet functionally different bacterial species. Circular probe-based RNA sequencing (ciRNAseq) achieves high-resolution microbiome profiling and therefore provides in-depth and unambiguous knowledge about the composition of the CVM. Based on ciRNAseq profiling of a large cohort of cervical smears (n = 541), we here define subgroups of CSTs I, III, and IV based on intra-CST differences with respect to abundances of Lactobacillus acidophilus (CSTs I-A vs. I-B and CSTs III-A vs. III-B), Lactobacillus iners (CSTs I-A vs. I-B and CSTs III-A vs. III-B), and Megasphaera genomosp type 1 (CSTs IV-A vs. IV-B). Our results further support the existence of subgroups of CST IV-C that are dominant for non-Lactobacillus species and have intermediate microbial diversity. We also show that CST V is associated with uninfected conditions, and CST IV-A associates with hrHPV-induced cervical disease. In conclusion, we characterized new subdivisions of cervicovaginal CSTs, which may further advance our understanding of women's cervical health and hrHPV-related progression to disease.",

We report the isolation and genomic-ecophysiological characterization of the first taurine-respiring mouse gut bacterium. Taurinivorans muris represents a new widespread species with protective capacity against pathogens and differs from the human gut sulfidogen Bilophila wadsworthia in its sulfur metabolism and host distribution. Despite alternative physiologies, taurine respiration was the main in vivo lifestyle of T. muris independent of mouse diet and genotype. In gnotobiotic mice, T. muris selectively enhanced the activity of a sulfur metabolism gene-encoding prophage and provided slightly increased colonization resistance against Salmonella Typhimurium, which showed reduced expression of galactonate catabolism genes. We identified T. muris as the dominant sulfidogen of a mouse microbiota that conferred H2S-mediated protection against Klebsiella pneumoniae in a previous study.

                            "abstract": "Little consensus exists about which statistical methods are most suitable for identifying differentially abundant (DA) taxa in microbiome research. A limitation of benchmarking DA methods is the lack of datasets with ground truth. Here, we introduce the MicrobiomeBenchmarkData package/resource of datasets with known biological ground truth and varying ecological complexity. We compiled and standardized three datasets: 1) a high-diversity dataset from the Human Microbiome Project contrasting subgingival and supragingival oral plaques using both 16S and shotgun data, 2) a low-diversity 16S dataset of healthy vaginal and bacterial vaginosis samples, and 3) a 16S spike-in dataset containing fixed amounts of foreign spiked-in bacteria across stool samples of patients who underwent allogeneic stem transplantation. We used the first two datasets to benchmark 17 differential abundance methods broadly categorized as classical, compositional, microbiome-specific, RNA-seq, and scRNA-seq tests. We used the third dataset to assess low variability of spiked-in bacteria. Overall, RNAseq methods performed best in the high-diversity dataset (gingiva) while most methods performed well in the low-diversity dataset (vagina). Notably, compositional methods proposed specifically for microbiome data analysis, performed equivalently to other methods in the high-complexity dataset but produced spurious results in the low-diversity dataset and increased unwanted variability of spike-in bacteria. The MicrobiomeBenchmarkData project aims to be a gold-standard resource of microbiome datasets for benchmarking DA methods based on biologically relevant signatures, following the data FAIRness principles of Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. Datasets are available as TSV text files through Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6911026), and as TreeSummarizedExperiment class objects through the MicrobiomeBenchmarkData R/Bioconductor package (https://waldronlab.io/MicrobiomeBenchmarkData).",

A signature represents statistically different bacterial taxa identified in a given study and represents a summary of a study\u2019s findings. These signatures can be assessed across studies for consistency and agreement. BugSigDB is a manually curated database of microbial signatures collected from published microbiome differential abundance studies. Key information for each study is curated including study design, sample size, participant information, laboratory methods, and statistical methods in a structured, standardized format. BugSigDB is open source and available for researchers to use and contribute to. As of January 11th, 2022 it contains 2,107 microbial signatures curated from 522 published microbiome research articles. We present an applied example of use of BugSigDB gut microbiome signatures for COVID-19. Analysis of 132 signatures from 32 studies of COVID-19 and the gut microbiome reveal significant co-occurrence of several bacterial taxa within the phylum Firmicutes along with Actinobacteria, Bacteriodetes, and Proteobacteria (Figure 1). Across these studies, the genera Bacteroides and Alistipes were statistically found to be in decreased abundance among COVID-19 patients. bugsigdbr, an accompanying open source R/Bioconductor package, provides signatures and accompanying data downloads in a tidy data format. Data can also be accessed via a semantic wiki web interface at https://bugsigdb.org. Together, they allow for efficient systematic analysis of findings from microbiome studies across a variety of diseases and conditions of interest.",

                            "abstract": "A mechanistic understanding of host-microbe interactions in the gut microbiome is hindered by poorly annotated bacterial genomes. While functional genomics can generate large gene-to-phenotype datasets to accelerate gene discovery, their applications to study gut anaerobes have been limited. For instance, most gain-of-function screens of gut bacterial genes have been performed in an aerobic host and included a small number of conditions. To address these challenges, we developed a strategy to barcode expression libraries for high-throughput interrogation of gene functions in competitive fitness assays. We demonstrate the power of this approach to uncover novel phenotypes for uncharacterized genes using pooled libraries constructed from a diverse set of gut Bacteroidales expressed in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. We identified new roles in carbohydrate metabolism for nine proteins, including enzymes, transporters, a regulator, and hypothetical proteins from mobile genetic elements. This approach can be readily applied to other organisms and additional phenotypic assays.\nLink to OA paper: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.05.510937v1",

The urogenital microbiome is a key component of the urinary environment. However, changes in the urogenital microbiome underlying rUTI susceptibility are unknown. Here, we perform shotgun metagenomics and advanced culture on urine from a controlled cohort of postmenopausal women to identify urogenital microbiome compositional and function changes linked to rUTI susceptibility. We identify candidate taxonomic biomarkers of rUTI susceptibility in postmenopausal women and an enrichment of lactobacilli in postmenopausal women taking estrogen hormone therapy. We find robust correlations between Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and urinary estrogens in women without urinary tract infection (UTI) history. Functional analyses reveal distinct metabolic and antimicrobial resistance gene (ARG) signatures associated with rUTI. Importantly, we find that ARGs are enriched in the urogenital microbiomes of women with rUTI history independent of current UTI status. Our data suggest that rUTI and estrogen shape the urogenital microbiome in postmenopausal women.\nLink to OA paper: https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(22)00302-0",

BV affects women during pregnancy and could lead to maternal-foetal outcomes that can be fatal for mothers and newborns. The aim of this review is to identify the different maternal and foetal outcomes among pregnant women with BV encountered worldwide and to highlight their prevalence. We search worldwide published articles that have recorded the prevalence of maternal-foetal outcomes among pregnant women with BV in the database Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and Global Index Medicus from inception until January 2022. The meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. Sources of heterogeneity were investigated using subgroup analysis, while funnel plots and Egger tests were performed to assess publication bias. This review was registered in PROSPERO with the number CRD42022299498. A total of 8254 articles were found in the searched databases. After the exclusion of duplicated articles and others for multiple reasons, we finally obtained 26 articles that met all inclusion criteria. Worldwide, we recorded separately 22 maternal outcomes and 22 foetal outcomes among pregnant women with BV. When analyzing the different worldwide outcomes combined, there are 5 maternal-fetal outcomes that have been reported with the highest prevalence namely preterm birth, before 37 wGA (17.9% [95%CI= 13-23.3]), mechanical ventilation (15.2% [95%CI= 0-45.9]), low birth weight, less than 2500 g (14.2% [95%CI= 9.1-20.1]), premature rupture of membrane, before 37 wGA (13.2% [95%CI= 6.1-22.3]) and neonatal intensive care unit admission (11.2 % [95%CI= 0-53.5]). We also found that at the level of the WHO Region, South-East Asia records the highest prevalence of maternal-foetal outcomes (25.5 % [95%CI = 17.5-34.4]) followed by Africa with a prevalence of (24.6% [95%CI= 16.8-33.4]). At the diagnostic level, we obtained the greatest prevalence (37.2% [95%CI= 23-52.6]) for BV diagnosed with Amsel criteria, then blue test (31.7 % [95%CI= 8.4-60.6]). When considering gestation age, we obtained a high prevalence (29.6% [95%CI= 21.2-38.8]) among pregnant women with BV diagnosed in the third trimester of pregnancy. Even if BV is one of the most common vaginal conditions, the repartition of the type of maternal-foetal outcomes among pregnant women positive for BV is grandly disproportional among countries and continents.",

                            "abstract": "Background Allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplant (allo-HSCT) is a potentially curative therapy for several hematological disorders. Before stem-cell infusion, recipients undergo a conditioning regimen with chemo/radiotherapy and immunosuppressants, requiring the use of antibiotics to treat and prevent infections. This regimen promotes drastic alterations in the recipient\u2032s microbiotas, including the oral microbiota, which have been associated with allo-HSCT complications and poor outcomes. However, long-term longitudinal studies on the oral microbiota of allo-HSCT recipients are scarce and disregard the existence of distinct microbiotas within the oral cavity. Here, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the microbiota dynamics (during and after allo-HSCT) of 31 allo-HSCT recipients at 3 oral sites (gingival crevicular fluid, oral mucosa, and supragingival biofilm). Results Analysis of the oral microbiota dynamics during allo-HSCT revealed a significant decline in bacterial diversity and major shifts in microbiota composition in all oral sites, including blooms of potentially pathogenic genera. These blooms in some cases preceded respiratory infections caused by the blooming genera. We also noticed that differences in microbiota diversity and composition between oral sites were lost during allo-HSCT. Overall, oral microbiotas returned to their preconditioning state after engraftment. However, the ability to recover the initial bacterial composition varied between patients. After stratifying patients based on their ability to recover their preconditioning microbiota composition, we found that recovery of the oral mucosa microbiota composition was not associated with antibiotic usage but was associated with higher preconditioning diversity and earlier reconstitution of normal leukocyte counts. Most notably, oral mucosa microbiota composition recovery was an independent biomarker of better allo-HSCT outcomes. Conclusion We observed clear patterns of microbiota dysbiosis in all three oral sites during allo-HSCT, however each oral site responded differently to the perturbations associated with allo-HSCT. Oral microbiota injury and recovery patterns were associated with allo-HSCT complications and outcomes. This study highlights the potential clinical impact of the oral microbiota in the allo-HSCT setting and the clinical value of tracking oral microbiota changes during allo-HSCT.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.18.22282520v1",

Here we show that sample collection time affects the conclusions drawn from microbiome studies and are larger than the effect size of a daily experimental intervention or dietary changes. The timing of divergence of the microbiome composition between experimental and control groups are unique to each experiment. Sample collection times as short as only four hours apart lead to vastly different conclusions. Lack of consistency in the time of sample collection may explain poor cross-study replicability in microbiome research.

Intratumoral host\u2013microbiota studies have so far largely relied on bulk tissue analysis, which obscures the spatial distribution and localized effect of the microbiota within tumours. Here, by applying in situ spatial-profiling technologies and single-cell RNA sequencing to oral squamous cell carcinoma and colorectal cancer, we reveal spatial, cellular and molecular host\u2013microbe interactions. We adapted 10x Visium spatial transcriptomics to determine the identity and in situ location of intratumoral microbial communities within patient tissues. Using GeoMx digital spatial profiling, we show that bacterial communities populate microniches that are less vascularized, highly immuno suppressive and associated with malignant cells with lower levels of Ki-67 as compared to bacteria-negative tumour regions. We developed a single-cell RNA-sequencing method that we name INVADEseq (invasion\u2013adhesion-directed expression sequencing) and, by applying this to patient tumours, identify cell-associated bacteria and the host cells with which they interact, as well as uncovering alterations in transcriptional pathways that are involved in inflammation, metastasis, cell dormancy and DNA repair. Through functional studies, we show that cancer cells that are infected with bacteria invade their surrounding environment as single cells and recruit myeloid cells to bacterial regions. Collectively, our data reveal that the distribution of the microbiota within a tumour is not random; instead, it is highly organized in microniches with immune and epithelial cell functions that promote cancer progression.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.07.515285v1",

                            "abstract": "Metagenomics has enabled the comprehensive study of microbiomes. However, many applications would benefit from a method that can sequence specific bacterial taxa of interest (pathogens, beneficial microbes, or low-abundance taxa), but not the vast background of other taxa in a microbiome sample. To address this need, we developed mEnrich-seq, a method that can enrich taxa of interest from metagenomic DNA before sequencing. The core idea is to exploit the self vs. non-self genome differentiation provided by natural bacterial DNA methylation and rationally choose methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes (REs), individually or in combination, to deplete host DNA and most background microbial DNA while enriching bacterial taxa of interest. This core idea is integrated with library preparation procedures in a way that only non-digested DNA libraries are sequenced. We performed in-depth evaluations of mEnrich-seq and demonstrated its use in several applications to enrich (up to 117-fold) genomic DNA of pathogenic or beneficial bacteria from human urine and fecal samples, including several species that are hard to culture or of low abundance. We also assessed the broad applicability of mEnrich-seq and found that 3130 (68.03%) of the 4601 strains with mapped methylomes to date can be targeted by at least one commercially available RE, representing 54.78% of the species examined in this analysis. mEnrich-seq provides microbiome researchers with a versatile and cost-effective approach for selective sequencing of diverse taxa of interest directly from the microbiome.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.07.515285v1",

In this recently published study, we investigated inherent instability, temporal dynamics, and the contribution of fed to the otherwise inaccessible small and large intestines. Longitudinal samples from the ileum before and after stoma formation indicated that ileostoma microbiotas represented that of the intact small intestine. Ileal and colonic stoma microbiotas were confirmed as distinct, and two types of instability: i) inter-digestive purging followed by the rapid postprandial blooming of bacterial biomass and sub-strain appearance and ii) disappearance within individual taxa after feeding. In contrast to the relative stability of colonic microbiota, small intestinal microbiota biomass and its sub-strain composition can be highly dynamic.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312822005157?dgcid=coauthor",

                            "abstract": "The release of wastewater treatment plant effluents into rivers exposes the river microbiome to a high load of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) along with complex mixtures of abiotic pollutants acting as stressors. \nTo understand the proliferation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) it is crucial to determine the factors that govern invasion of ARB into the river microbiome. Consequently, we here aim at elucidating how the resilience of the resident microbial communities against invasion by foreign ARB is affected by co-released stressors.\nTo achieve this, we grew natural microbial biofilms on glass slides in rivers for one month. The biofilms were then transferred to laboratory, recirculating flume systems and exposed to a single pulse of a model resistant invader bacterium (E. coli) either in presence or absence of stress induced by Cu2+. The invasion dynamics of E. coli into the biofilms were then monitored for 14 days. Despite an initially successful introduction of E. coli into the biofilms, independent of the imposed stress, over time the invader perished in absence of stress. However, under stress the invading strain successfully established and proliferated in the biofilms. Noteworthy, the increased establishment success of the invader coincided with a loss in microbial community diversity under stress conditions, likely due to additional niche space becoming available for the invader.\nIn conclusion, we demonstrate that the intrinsic resilience of the river microbiome towards invasion by ARB is strongly linked with maintaining diversity and that co-exposure to stressors that disrupt community diversity and structure increases long-term invasion success.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.19.517188v1",

                            "abstract": "Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, there has been much speculation about how COVID-19 and antimicrobial resistance may be interconnected. In this study, untreated wastewater was sampled from Hospital A designated to treat COVID-19 patients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic alongside Hospital B that did not receive any COVID-19 patients. Metagenomics was used to determine the relative abundance and mobile potential of antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs), prior to determining the correlation of ARGs with time/incidence of COVID-19. Our findings showed that ARGs resistant to macrolides, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines were positively correlated with time in Hospital A but not in Hospital B. Likewise, minor extended spectrum betalactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemases of classes B and D were positively correlated with time, suggesting the selection of rare and/or carbapenem-resistant genes in Hospital A. This study highlighted concerns related to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) during the COVID-19 pandemic that may arise from antibiotic use and untreated hospital wastewater.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.2c01834",

                            "abstract": "More than 15 years ago, it was hypothesised that the gut microbiota could causally affect weight gain due to the gut microbiome\u2019s capacity to extract energy from the diet. Yet, evidence linking microbiome-dependent energy harvest to particular human gut microbiome compositions have been lacking. In this recently published study, we investigated whether energy extraction from the diet in 85 overweight adults, estimated by dry stool energy density, was associated with intestinal transit time and variations in microbial community diversity and structure. We found opposite of what we expected that stool energy density was positively associated with intestinal transit time. Furthermore, individuals with a Bacteroides enterotype (B-type) had significantly lower energy left in faeces (per gram dried faeces) compared to individuals with a Ruminococcaecea enterotype (R-type). The B-type individuals had lower alpha-diversity and faster intestinal transit time, but also a significantly higher body weight compared to the R-type individuals. Furthermore, markers of proteolytic fermentation were increased in the R-type compared to the B-type. Together, this could suggest that human gut microbiome-dependent energy extraction is diversified according to intestinal transit time and gut microbiome ecosystem variations as reflected by enterotypes. While the causalities remain to be established, the observations are intriguing and could provide new dietary strategies in body weight management. \n\nLink to OA paper: https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-022-01418-5",

However, for reasons that are poorly understood, these responses are highly variable between individuals. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the composition and function of the gut microbiota is a critical factor modulating immune responses to vaccination, and when the gut microbiota is disrupted, such as with antibiotic exposure, it may lead to suboptimal vaccine responses (e.g. lower antibody titres). \nAt the Lynn Systems Immunology group we use multi-omic technologies to study the relationship between the gut microbiota and vaccine responses in both humans and preclinical murine models. Here, I will report on findings from the Antibiotics and Immune Responses (AIR) study which followed 170 infants for the first 15 months of life to assess how early life antibiotic exposure shapes the composition of the gut microbiota, immune function and responses to scheduled infant vaccinations.",

Within the human gut the bacterial concentration is estimated to be around 1011 cells per gram of faeces, yet the phage concentration is significantly lower at around 109 phages per gram of faeces. However, these raw counts fail to capture the prophages, which are integrated phages residing withing a bacterial host chromosome. Prophages can constitute up to 20% of the host bacterial genome, greatly impacting their host\u2019s function, evolution, and diversification. Here we characterised a large collection of bacterial isolates originating from the human gut and identify their prophage elements. Using a broad panel of induction conditions under anaerobic conditions we identify and begin to experimentally characterise these novel and actively replicating temperate phages of the human gut.",

Previous investigations have suggested that vaginal microbes and metabolites may be implicated in sPTB. Here we performed untargeted metabolomics on 232 second-trimester vaginal samples, 80 from pregnancies ending preterm. We find multiple associations between vaginal metabolites and subsequent preterm birth, and propose that several of these metabolites, including diethanolamine and ethyl glucoside, are exogenous. We observe associations between the metabolome and microbiome profiles previously obtained using 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing, including correlations between bacteria considered suboptimal, such as Gardnerella\u2009vaginalis, and metabolites enriched in term pregnancies, such as tyramine. We investigate these associations using metabolic models. We use machine learning models to predict sPTB risk from metabolite levels, weeks to months before birth, with good accuracy (area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.78). These models, which we validate using two external cohorts, are more accurate than microbiome-based and maternal covariates-based models (area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.55\u20130.59). Our results demonstrate the potential of vaginal metabolites as early biomarkers of sPTB and highlight exogenous exposures as potential risk factors for prematurity.\n\nLink to paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01293-8",

SCFAs lower blood pressure in experimental models2,3,4,5, but their translational potential is unknown. Here we present the results of a phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over trial (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12619000916145) using prebiotic acetylated and butyrylated high-amylose maize starch (HAMSAB) supplementation6. Twenty treatment-naive participants with hypertension were randomized to 40\u2009g per day of HAMSAB or placebo, completing each arm for 3\u2009weeks, with a 3-week washout period between them. The primary endpoint was a reduction in ambulatory systolic blood pressure. Secondary endpoints included changes to circulating cytokines, immune markers and gut microbiome modulation. Patients receiving the HAMSAB treatment showed a clinically relevant reduction in 24-hour systolic blood pressure independent of age, sex and body mass index without any adverse effects. HAMSAB increased levels of acetate and butyrate, shifted the microbial ecosystem and expanded the prevalence of SCFA producers. In summary, a prebiotic intervention with HAMSAB could represent a promising option to deliver SCFAs and lower blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension.\n\nLink to paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-022-00197-4",

                            "abstract": "Recently, the Bork group published a tool called GUNC (the Genome UNClutter) that detects chimerism and contamination in prokaryotic genomes. Disturbingly, they estimated that 3.2% (1009) of all species in release 95 of the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) consist entirely of contaminated genomes, which could inflate estimates of phylogenetic diversity and taxonomic novelty. We applied GUNC to the latest release of GTDB and found the situation is even worse, with 6.0% (3,958) of all species in release 207 estimated to be comprised entirely of contaminated genomes.\n\nTo address the question of whether this contamination compromises the GTDB taxonomy by inflating phylogenetic diversity, we split putative chimeric genomes into halves according to their GUNC contamination scores. We then inferred phylogenetic trees from the genome halves as per the standard GTDB workflow, i.e. based on a concatenated alignment of up to 120 single copy marker genes, to determine any changes in genus to phylum classifications between pairs of genome halves. We also subjected the genome halves to average nucleotide identity (ANI)-based analysis, which is how species are assigned in GTDB. These analyses allowed us to quantify taxonomic inflation caused by genomic contamination, and the extent to which the GTDB taxonomy has been compromised. Tune in to find out the results!",

In these studies, machine learning is used to infer CRC biomarkers using global explanation methods. While these methods allow the identification of bacteria generally correlated with CRC, they fail to recognize species that are only influential for some individuals. In this study, we investigate the potential of Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) for a more personalized CRC biomarker identification. Analyses of five independent datasets show that this method can even separate CRC subjects into subgroups with distinct CRC probabilities and bacterial biomarkers. \n\nLink to OA paper: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-023-02858-4",

                            "abstract": "Publicly available microbiome data have become of sufficient scope for meta-analysis on a range of phenotypes, conditions, and health-related outcomes. This led to unprecedented results that were made possible thanks to the effort of integration of multiple microbiome cohorts. The wide-spread exploitation of public metagenomic dataset is however hampered by the lack of accessibility and standardization that are barriers to their use. To allow fast and convenient acquisition and harmonization of public microbiome data, we have developed curatedMetagenomicData (cMD) 3, an R/Biocoductor data-package deploying 22,710 publicly available human metagenomic samples from 94 cohorts and 42 countries. Samples in cMD 3 are uniformly profiled via the bioBakery 3 softwares MetaPhlAn 3 and HUMAnN 3.0, respectively for the taxonomic and the functional potential profiling. In addition, cMD 3 provides sample- and subject-related manually curated clinical and technical attributes organised in a coded vocabulary, allowing the easy retrieval and re-usage of microbiome datasets. In this resource paper, we present cMD 3. We use it to address several challenges in the current human microbiome epidemiology, with greater sample size and diversity of populations than previously possible. Via random-effects meta-analysis we identify species and metabolic features associated with sex (102 taxa, 15 Metacyc pathways, and 226 KEGG-Orthologs, Q lower than 0.01), age (91 taxa and 1,991 functions, Q lower than 0.01) or BMI (195 taxa and 1,018 functions, Q lower than 0.01). We investigate cross-disease, cross-cohort (15 diseases, 30 cohorts) species-level and pathway-level associations (34 species and 215 pathways, Q lower than 0.01). We then use the oral samples available through cMD 3 to define a simple \u201coral to gut introgression\u201d score that can be easily calculated in any fecal sample as the summed relative abundance of 305 species identified from 425 oral metagenomes. This score is more frequently elevated than decreased in diseases (27 of 30 studies, P = 8.4 x 10-6, binomial test), representing a quantitative index of deviation from health-associated microbiome configurations. Together these analyses show the potential of the novel cMD 3, assessing the relationship between human microbiome and basic and clinical host outcomes and identifying modest but widely shared variation in human microbiomes that will serve as a reproducible and readily updatable reference.",

In particular, intestinal roundworms such as Ascaris suum affect more than 1 billion people around the globe and are a major issue in animal husbandry. These pathogens live in intimate contact with the host gut microbiota and harbor bacteria within their own intestines. Knowledge of the bacterial host microbiome at the site of infection is limited and data on the parasite microbiome is, to the best of our knowledge, non-existent. The intestinal microbiome of Ascaris suum was analyzed in contrast to the diversity and composition of the infected host gut. 16S sequencing of the parasite intestine and host intestinal compartments showed that the parasite gut has a significantly less diverse microbiome than its host and the host gut exhibits a reduced microbiome diversity at the site of parasite infection in the jejunum. While the host\u2019s microbiome composition at the site of infection significantly determines the microbiome composition of its parasite, microbial signatures differentiate the nematodes from their hosts as the Ascaris intestine supports the growth of microbes that are otherwise under-represented in the host gut. Our data clearly indicate that a nematode infection reduces the microbiome diversity of the host gut and that the nematode gut represents a selective bacterial niche harboring bacteria that are derived but distinct from the host gut.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-022-01399-5",

                            "abstract": "Over the last decades, the sequencing of environmental DNA by metagenomics has provided the genomes of thousands of uncultivated bacterial and archaeal lineages, revealing an enormous amount of previously unknown genes. Even though recent studies have highlighted the apparent importance of these novel genes, their overall significance is still largely unexplored. Here, we applied a comprehensive comparative genomics approach to identify high-quality novel protein families exclusive from uncultivated species, and characterized them from a functional, ecological and evolutionary point of view. For such a purpose, we computed protein families from a large multi-habitat metagenomic dataset covering 400M genes from 170k genomes spanning the prokaryotic phylogeny. We then applied strict quality and novelty filters to avoid incomplete genes, assembling artifacts, distant homologs and potential pseudogenes. This led us to uncovering 400K high-quality gene families exclusive from uncultivated taxa, twice the number of gene families in reference databases like EggNOG. These high-quality novel gene families are widespread within and across habitats, indicating their ecological value. They also spread out across the microbial phylogeny and are notably overrepresented in recently discovered taxa. Most remarkably, we found that 980 previously neglected protein families can accurately distinguish entire uncultivated phyla, classes and orders, likely representing synapomorphic traits. We inferred the putative functional roles of the high-quality novel gene families by reconstructing their genomic neighborhood and estimating their degree of functional context conservation. 18% of the novel protein families are present in phylogenetically conserved operon regions, in some cases involving key metabolic genes, suggesting they may take part in central microbial processes. In order to facilitate the characterization of novel gene families in relevant genomic contexts, we developed http://novelgenefamilies.compgenomics.org, which allows to browse and visualize the genomic neighbors of any of our novel gene family predictions. Overall, our work provides a global phylogenomic analysis of the largely uncharted repertoire of unique genes from uncultured prokaryotes, serving as a base resource for further investigations on their functional and ecological roles.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.26.477801v1",

This pioneer microbiota may be vulnerable to antibiotic exposures, but could be supported by prebiotic oligosaccharides found in breast milk and some infant formulas. We sought to characterize the effects of several exposures on the neonatal gut microbiota, including human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), and infant/maternal antimicrobial exposures. We profiled the stool microbiota of 1023 one-month-old infants from the KOALA Birth Cohort using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We quantified 15 HMOs in breast milk from the mothers of 220 infants, using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Both breastfeeding and antibiotic exposure decreased gut microbial diversity, but each was associated with contrasting shifts in microbiota composition. Other factors associated with microbiota composition included C-section, homebirth, siblings, and exposure to animals. Neither infant exposure to oral antifungals nor maternal exposure to antibiotics during pregnancy were associated with infant microbiota composition. Four distinct groups of breast milk HMO compositions were evident, corresponding to maternal Secretor status and Lewis group combinations defined by the presence/absence of certain fucosylated HMOs. However, we found the strongest evidence for microbiota associations between two non-fucosylated HMOs: 6\u2019-sialyllactose (6\u2019-SL) and lacto-N-hexaose (LNH), which were associated with lower and higher relative abundances of Bifidobacterium, respectively. Among 111 exclusively formula-fed infants, the GOS-supplemented formula was associated with a lower relative abundance of Clostridium perfringens. In conclusion, the gut microbiota is sensitive to some prebiotic and antibiotic exposures during early infancy and understanding their effects could inform future strategies for safeguarding a health-promoting infant gut microbiota.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2022.2164152",

Co-evolution of host and microbiome has influenced the functionality of both the microbiome and host such that metabolic complementarity exists within the microbiota and that critical biosynthetic pathways are provided for the host that significantly extend host metabolic capacity. Of all the \u2018omics\u2019 technologies, metabonomics provides one of the most accessible windows on investigating the impact of the microbiome on human health since metabolic profiles of easily obtainable biofluids such as blood plasma and urine carry information relating both to genetic and environmental influences, including microbiome-diet and microbiome-xenobiotic interactions. High resolution spectroscopy together with multivariate mathematical modelling has been used to model the metabolic consequences of perturbing the microbiota and to profile the effects of nutritional interventions on both the metabolism and the microbiome. Basic studies in germ free and antibiotic-treated animals have shown stark changes in the urinary and faecal metabolomes, which are largely restored to \u2018normal\u2019 following recolonization. Recent research indicates that the microbial metabolites can be predictive of response to drug treatment and to diet. This presentation describes the use of metabolic profiling to evaluate the impact of the gut microbiome on human health and focuses on applications in early and later life.",

Isolate studies have revealed the genetic basis for HMO metabolism, but they exclude the possibility of HMO assimilation via synergistic interactions involving multiple organisms. Here, we investigated microbiome responses to 2'-fucosyllactose (2\u2019FL), a prevalent HMO and infant formula additive, by establishing individualized microbiomes using fecal samples from three different infants as the inocula. Bifidobacterium breve, a prominent member of infant microbiomes, typically cannot metabolize 2\u2019FL. Using metagenomic data, we predicted that extracellular fucosidases encoded by co-existing members such as Ruminococcus gnavus initiate 2\u2019FL breakdown, thus critical for B. breve\u2019s growth. Using both targeted co-cultures and by supplementation of R. gnavus into one microbiome, we show that R. gnavus can promote extensive growth of B. breve through the release of lactose from 2\u2019FL. Overall, microbiome cultivation combined with genome-resolved metagenomics demonstrated that HMO utilization can vary with an individual\u2019s microbiome.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.10.532136v1",

                            "abstract": "Background: Color Vision Deficiency (CVD), commonly known as colorblindness, affects approximately 300 million people worldwide. Individuals with CVD do not experience complete loss of color vision, but have reduced ability to distinguish different colors. When creating scientific figures, it is important to consider that individuals with CVD may not perceive all colors as intended. While there are several CVD friendly color palettes available, they are often insufficient for visualizing complex data that is often generated in microbiome studies. Methods: To overcome CVD accessibility for microbiome datasets, we developed an R package, microshades. Microshades includes CVD accessible color palettes and data organization functions. To construct the palettes, hue (type of color), chroma (colorfulness), and luminance (brightness) were adjusted for optimal visual distinction and CVD accessibility. All shades were tested with a CVD simulator (cvdemulator) for accessibility. In addition to accessible color palettes, we also provide data organization functions. These include grouping data by taxonomic ranking, sorting the data vertically and horizontally, and restructuring the plot legends. Results: Each microshades color palette contains six hues with five sequential variations of chroma and luminance per hue, for a total of 30 available colors per palette. The microshades_cvd_palettes colors are universally CVD accessible to individuals with the three most common types of CVD (Deuteranope, Protanope, and Tritanope). The individual hues of the microshades_palettes colors are CVD friendly, but when used in conjunction with multiple hues, may not be universally accessible to all forms of CVD. Discussion: The microshades R package is a visualization tool designed for microbiome researchers. The package contains two CVD accessible palettes, along with several organization features. The microshades package can be used in conjunction with common microbiome R packages, such as phyloseq, to enhance microbiome data visualization.\n\nLink to paper: https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mra.00795-22",

                            "abstract": "Background. Assembly of the human gut microbiome during early life is a complex and dynamic process. Aberrations to the early gut microbiome have been repeatedly associated with later-life disease. While previous studies have explored the temporal development of the infant gut microbiome, none have done so in an exclusively breastfed population, nor in an Australian context. Here, we characterized the temporal development of the breastfed infant gut microbiome over the first 12 months of life in the BLOSOM birth cohort.\nMethods. Infant stool samples were collected at 2-5 days, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 12 months of age (n=684 samples from 85 infants). The gut microbiome was analysed using PacBio full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing.\nResults. Exclusive breastfeeding was a strong determinant of the infant gut microbiome, with introduction of solid food driving a rapid and dramatic expansion in the gut community. Richness and Shannon diversity remained stable over the first 5 months of life, followed by a significant increase in diversity from 6 to 12 months (P&lt;0.0001). Bifidobacterium was the dominant genera in this cohort, with Bifidobacterium longum supsp. infantis representing the most abundant species (27% relative abundance across all samples). Bifidobacterium relative abundance increased across the first 4 months of life from a mean relative abundance of 23% at 2-5 days to 46% at 4 months. Bifidobacterium levels then began to steadily decline from 5 to 12 months (12 month mean relative abundance = 33%). The persistence of this health-promoting genera a 12 months of age is likely a reflection of the high breastfeeding retention rates in the BLOSOM cohort (&gt;80% still breastfeeding at 12 months of age). C-section delivery was a major determinant of the infant gut microbiome, with significant impacts on Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides. Similar impacts were seen in vaginally delivered infants whose mothers were exposed to intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, suggesting that antibiotic exposure related to delivery mode, rather than delivery mode per se, is responsible for the effect.\nConclusion. In the first study of gut microbiome assembly in exclusively breastfed Australian infants, we demonstrate a high abundance of Bifidobacterium that persists to 12 months of age. Our results also demonstrate the dramatic impact of introduction of solid foods, and exposure to intra-partum antibiotics. These data illustrate \u201coptimal\u201d infant gut microbiome development associated with vaginal delivery and breastfeeding.",

                            "abstract": "Understanding the evolutionary relationships between a host and its intestinal resident bacteria can transform how we understand adaptive phenotypic traits. The interplay between hosts and their resident bacteria inevitably affects the intestinal environment and, thereby, the living conditions of both the host and the microbiota. Thereby this co-existence likely influences the fitness of both bacteria and host. Whether this co-existence leads to evolutionary co-diversification in animals is largely unexplored, mainly due to the complexity of the environment and microbial communities and the often low host selection. We present the gut metagenome from wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), a new wild organism model with an intestinal microbiota of low complexity and a well-described population structure, making it well-suited for investigating co-evolution. Our data reveal a strong host selection of a core gut microbiota dominated by a single Mycoplasma species. We found a clear co-diversification between the population structure of Atlantic salmon and nucleotide variability of the intestinal Mycoplasma populations conforming to expectations from co-evolution between host and resident bacteria. Our results show that the stable microbiota of Atlantic salmon has evolved with its salmonid host populations while potentially providing adaptive traits to the salmon host populations, including defence mechanisms, biosynthesis of essential amino acids, and metabolism of B vitamins. We highlight Atlantic salmon as a novel model for studying co-evolution between vertebrate hosts and their resident bacteria.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41396-023-01379-z",

                            "abstract": "The human body is inhabited by a community of diverse bacteria, archaea, viruses, fungi, and microeukaryotes, collectively called the human microbiome, that impact human health. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing enables high-resolution profiling of all members of the community. While the bacterial constituents have been investigated extensively, organisms from other domains, such as eukaryotes, are currently underexplored. Blastocystis spp. is a common eukaryotic protist that lives in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and other animals. The ecological and clinical significance of Blastocystis is still controversial, as it has been associated both with gastrointestinal symptoms and has been found in asymptomatic individuals. We performed a large-scale data harmonization and analysis of more than 50,000 metagenomic samples (34,687 from the ZOE PREDICT Studies, 13,928 from 68 public studies on humans, and 4,623 animal samples from 50 public studies) to investigate Blastocystis presence in the gut microbiome. Our results suggest a potentially favorable role for Blastocystis. We observed a worldwide presence of Blastocystis among healthy individuals with prevalence variability linked to host age, lifestyle, and geographical provenance. We established a dose-dependent coupling of Blastocystis carriage and diet quality, showing that Blastocystis-positive individuals tended to consume healthier, less-processed, fiber-enriched foods. Moreover, we show that the presence of Blastocystis was associated with favorable near-term fasting and postprandial cardiometabolic markers, such as lower GlycA and higher HDL. Finally, we reveal through meta-analysis a robust and reproducible association between the presence of Blastocystis and a lower body mass index, as well as reduced risk for inflammatory bowel diseases, colorectal cancer, and diabetes. Overall, the widespread presence of Blastocystis among healthy individuals suggests that, although associated with disease in certain conditions, it could be a non-pathogenic member of the gut microbiome. Further genomic studies are needed to unravel the specific role of Blastocystis subspecies in human health and disease. Finally, our work serves as an example of how shotgun metagenomic datasets can help investigate the non-bacterial components of the human microbiome.",

                            "abstract": "Whether the human fetus and the prenatal intrauterine environment (amniotic fluid and placenta) are stably colonized by microbial communities in a healthy pregnancy remains a subject of debate. Here we evaluate recent studies that characterized microbial populations in human fetuses from the perspectives of reproductive biology, microbial ecology, bioinformatics, immunology, clinical microbiology and gnotobiology, and assess possible mechanisms by which the fetus might interact with microorganisms. Our analysis indicates that the detected microbial signals are likely the result of contamination during the clinical procedures to obtain fetal samples or during DNA extraction and DNA sequencing. Furthermore, the existence of live and replicating microbial populations in healthy fetal tissues is not compatible with fundamental concepts of immunology, clinical microbiology and the derivation of germ-free mammals. These conclusions are important to our understanding of human immune development and illustrate common pitfalls in the microbial analyses of many other low-biomass environments. The pursuit of a fetal microbiome serves as a cautionary example of the challenges of sequence-based microbiome studies when biomass is low or absent, and emphasizes the need for a trans-disciplinary approach that goes beyond contamination controls by also incorporating biological, ecological and mechanistic concepts\n\nLink to paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05546-8",

Social network interactions may thereby also shape the composition and diversity of the microbiome at individual and population levels. Here, we use comprehensive social network and detailed microbiome sequencing data in 1,098 adults across 9 isolated villages in Honduras to investigate the relationship between social network structure and microbiome composition. Using both species-level and strain-level data, we show that microbial sharing occurs between many relationship types, notably including non-familial and non-household connections. Using strain-sharing data alone, we can confidently predict a wide variety of relationship types (AUC ~0.73). This strain-level sharing extends to second-degree social connections in a network, suggesting the importance of the extended network with respect to microbiome composition. We also observe that socially central individuals are more microbially similar to the overall village than those on the social periphery. Finally, we observe that clusters of microbiome species and strains occur within clusters of people in the village social networks, providing the social niches in which microbiome biology and phenotypic impact are manifested.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.06.535875v1",

Emerging evidence implicates gut microorganisms and microbiota composition in cognitive outcomes and neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., autism and anxiety), but the influence of gut microbial metabolism on typical neurodevelopment has not been explored in detail. We investigated the relationship of the microbiome with the neuroanatomy and cognitive function of 361 healthy children, demon- strating that differences in gut microbial taxa and gene functions are associated with overall cognitive function and with differences in the size of multiple brain regions. Using a combination of multivariate linear and machine learning (ML) models, we showed that many species, including Gordonibacter pamelae and Blautia wexlerae, were significantly associated with higher cognitive function, while some species such as Ruminococcus gnavus were more commonly found in children with low cognitive scores after controlling for sociodemographic factors. Microbial genes for enzymes involved in the metabolism of neuroactive compounds, particularly short-chain fatty acids such as acetate and propionate, were also associated with cognitive function. In addition, ML models were able to use microbial taxa to predict the volume of brain regions, and many taxa that were identified as important in predicting cognitive function also dominated the feature importance metric for individual brain regions. For example, B. wexlerae was the most important species in models predicting the size of the parahippocampal region in both the left and right hemispheres, while several species from the phylum Bacteroidetes, including GABA-producing B. ovatus, were important for predicting the size of the left accumbens area, but not the right. These findings provide potential biomarkers of neurocognition and brain development and may lead to the future development of targets for early detection and early intervention.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.13.944181",

Here, we used multi-omic profiling to characterize interactions between maternal genetics, milk gene expression, milk composition, and the infant fecal microbiome in 242 exclusively breastfeeding mother-infant pairs. We identified 487 genetic loci harboring variants associated with milk cell gene expression unique to the lactating mammary gland. Genetic effects on milk gene expression included genes with roles in the biosynthesis of specific human milk oligosaccharides (HMO), including a genetic variant that increases the expression of the gene GCNT3 in milk and is also associated with increased concentration of the HMO FLNH. Integrative analyses uncovered connections between milk gene expression and infant gut microbiome, including an association between the expression of inflammation-related genes with IL-6 concentration in milk and the abundance of Bifidobacteria in the infant gut. Our results show how an improved understanding of the genetics and genomics of human milk connects lactation biology with maternal and infant health.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.24.525211v1",

Until around three years of age, the development of the infant gut microbiome remains highly plastic and easily influenced by environmental factors. Developing a diverse and rich gut microbiome during this sensitive period is crucial to setting up a stable gut microbiome into adulthood, and to prevent gut dysbiosis. We have characterised the overall composition and functional profiles of the 6-month old gut microbiome using whole genome shotgun metagenomics sequencing and identified the key influencing environmental factors. Specifically, we discuss the effect of timing of solid food introduction, and feeding method on diversity. We also identified the differences in colonising species between breastfed and bottle-fed infants. We found the 6-month gut microbiome to be characterised by high rates of inter-individual variation. We also found infants fed exclusively formula milk had a higher overall diversity than infants fed a breastmilk diet and breastfed infants had a higher abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. We also did not identify any significantly different metabolic pathways between different environmental factors.",

                            "abstract": "Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) are devastating conditions of the gastrointestinal tract with limited treatments, and dietary intervention may be effective, affordable, and safe for managing symptoms. Ongoing research has identified inactive compounds in broccoli sprouts, like glucoraphanin, and that mammalian gut microbiota play a role in metabolizing it to the anti-inflammatory sulforaphane. The objectives were to identify biogeographic location of participating microbiota and correlate that to health outcomes. We fed specific pathogen free C57BL/6 mice either a control diet or a 10% steamed broccoli sprout diet, and gave a three-cycle regimen of 2.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water over a 40-day experiment to simulate chronic, relapsing ulcerative colitis. We monitored body weight, fecal characteristics, fecal lipocalin, and sequenced bacterial communities from the contents and mucosa in the jejunum, cecum, and colon. Mice fed the broccoli sprout diet while receiving DSS performed better than mice fed the control diet while receiving DSS for all disease parameters, including significantly more weight gain (2-way ANOVA, p lower than 0.05), lower Disease Activity Index scores (2-way ANOVA, p lower than 0.001), and higher bacterial richness in all gut locations (linear regression model, p lower than 0.01 for all locations measured). Bacterial communities were assorted by gut location except in the mice receiving the control diet and DSS treatment (Beta-diversity, ANOVA, p lower than 0.05 for each). Importantly, our results suggested that broccoli sprout feeding completely abrogated the effects of DSS on gut microbiota, as bacterial communities were similar between mice receiving broccoli sprouts with and without DSS. Spatially resolved microbial communities provide greater insight when investigating host-microbe interactions. Here, we show that a 10% broccoli sprout diet protects mice from the negative effects of dextran sodium sulfate induced colitis, that colitis erases biogeographical patterns of bacterial communities in the gut, and that the cecum is not likely to be a significant contributor to colonic bacteria of interest in the DSS mouse model of ulcerative colitis.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.27.522641v2",

                            "abstract": "Fusobacterium nucleatum, a ubiquitous member of the human oral and gut microbiomes, is strongly associated with the development of multiple human diseases including periodontitis, oral/extraoral abscesses, and several types of cancer. F. nucleatum is currently divided into four subspecies: F. nucleatum subspecies nucleatum (Fn. nucleatum), animalis (Fn. animalis), polymorphum (Fn. polymorphum), and vincentii/fusiforme (Fn. vincentii). Although these subspecies have been historically considered as functionally interchangeable, recent clinical studies of colorectal tumor-associated F. nucleatum have suggested this perception may be inaccurate. Consequently, we aimed to determine whether F. nucleatum subspecies prevalence in the oral cavity correlates with oral health status. Patient-matched specimens of dental plaque and odontogenic abscess were analyzed with both culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches using 58 and 44 paired samples, respectively. Pangenome, phylogenetic and functional enrichment analysis of Fusobacterium species and F. nucleatum subspecies were conducted using the Anvi\u2019o workflow. Both culture-independent and -dependent analyses similarly revealed a highly biased distribution of F. nucleatum subspecies in the oral cavity, with most patients harboring multiple subspecies. In dental plaque, Fn. polymorphum is the dominant organism, whereas Fn. animalis is particularly prevalent within abscesses. Surprisingly, the most heavily studied subspecies, Fn. nucleatum, was only a minor constituent within the entire specimen collection. In agreement with the clinical data, phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses identified substantial distinctions among F. nucleatum subspecies. The heterogeneous distribution of F. nucleatum subspecies within oral plaque and abscess specimens reveals niche-specific preferences, with Fn. animalis likely exhibiting the greatest pathogenic potential. Both the clinical and genomic data strongly suggest that each F. nucleatum subspecies likely comprises unique Fusobacterium species.",

                            "abstract": "Background. Following solid organ transplantation, tacrolimus (TAC) is an essential drug in the immunosuppressive strategy. Its use constitutes a challenge due to its narrow therapeutic index and its high inter- and intra- pharmacokinetic (PK) variability. As the contribution of the gut microbiota to drug metabolism is now emerging, it might be explored as one of the factors explaining TAC PK variability. Herein, we studied the contribution of the gut microbiota to TAC PK, using a combination of in vivo and in vitro models. Results. TAC oral administration was performed in mice. Compared to controls, mice with a lower intestinal microbial load due to antibiotics administration exhibit a 33% reduction in TAC whole blood exposure and a lower inter-individual variability. This reduction in TAC levels was strongly correlated with higher expression of the efflux transporter ABCB1 (also known as the p-glycoprotein (P-gp) or the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1)) in the small intestine. Conventionalization of germ-free mice confirmed the ability of the gut microbiota to downregulate ABCB1 expression in a site-specific fashion. The functional inhibition of ABCB1 in vivo by zosuquidar formally established the implication of this efflux transporter in the modulation of TAC PK by the gut microbiota. Furthermore, we showed that polar bacterial metabolites could recapitulate the transcriptional regulation of ABCB1 by the gut microbiota, without affecting its functionality. Finally, whole transcriptome analyses pinpointed, among others, the Constitutive Androstane Receptor (CAR) as a transcription factor likely to mediate the impact of the gut microbiota on ABCB1 transcriptional regulation. Conclusions. We highlight for the first time how the modulation of ABCB1 expression by bacterial metabolites results in changes in TAC PK, affecting not only blood levels but also the inter-individual variability. More broadly, considering the high number of drugs with unexplained PK variability transported by ABCB1, our work is of clinical importance and paves the way for incorporating the gut microbiota in prediction algorithms for dosage of such drugs.\n\nLink to OA paper: http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40168-023-01578-y",

Recently, we reported that the most prevalent Corynebacterium species found on skin, including Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum and Corynebacterium kefirresidentii, comprise a narrow species complex despite the diversity of the genus. Here, we apply high-resolution phylogenomics and comparative genomics to describe the structure of the C. tuberculostearicum species complex and highlight genetic traits which are enriched or depleted in it relative to other Corynebacterium. Through metagenomic investigations, we also find that individual species within the complex can associate with specific body sites. Finally, we discover that one species from the complex, C. kefirresidentii, increases in relative abundance during atopic dermatitis flares, and show that most genomes of this species encode a colocalized set of putative virulence genes.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/spectrum.03578-22",

                            "abstract": "The Microbiome Virtual International Forum (MVIF) is a substitute for multi-day microbiome conferences. MVIF was created by microbiome scientists with intent to be free, beneficial, and convenient for scientists all over the world, no matter their career stage. The MVIF creators are hoping to make the event as productive as possible. Therefore, in this NSURP2023 project (https://nsurp.org/), my aim was to compare MVIF Season 1 and MVIF Season 2 by compiling speakers\u2019 information from https://www.microbiome-vif.org/en-US/-/past-events and documenting it in a Google Sheet. I hypothesized that there would be a few differences between the seasons in some aspects of the past MVIF events. The speakers\u2019 metadata was analyzed using Python libraires: pandas, numpy and matplotlib. The results showed that there were a total of 142 speakers with 53% being females and the remaining 47% being males. For both seasons, most of the speakers\u2019 affiliated locations were the USA and European countries and their talks focused on the human gut and bioinformatics. I was able to see a difference between the two seasons: Season 1 had a total of 82 speakers (with consequently a higher number of talks) whereas Season 2 had 60 speakers. Although season 1 had more diverse microbiome topics, in Season 2 there\u2019s a slight increase in non-human microbiome topics, such as water microbiome. From September, there will be a new season with an effort to amplify more diverse voices of microbiome science.",

                            "abstract": "The human skin microbiome represents a variety of complex microbial ecosystems that play a key role in host health. Molecular methods to study these communities have been developed but have been largely limited to low-throughput quantification and short amplicon-based sequencing, providing limited functional information about the communities present. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing has emerged as a preferred method for microbiome studies as it provides more comprehensive information about the species/strains present in a niche and the genes they encode. However, the relatively low bacterial biomass of skin, in comparison to other areas such as the gut microbiome, makes obtaining sufficient DNA for shotgun metagenomic sequencing challenging. Here we describe an optimised high-throughput method for extraction of high molecular weight DNA suitable for shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We validated the performance of the extraction method, and analysis pipeline on skin swabs collected from both adults and babies. The pipeline effectively characterised the bacterial skin microbiota with a cost and throughput suitable for larger longitudinal sets of samples. Application of this method will allow greater insights into community compositions and functional capabilities of the skin microbiome.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/mgen/10.1099/mgen.0.001058",

Application of cpn60 barcode sequencing is facilitated by 'universal' amplification primers and cpnDB, a manually curated reference database of cpn60 sequences. Recent developments to the cpn60 platform include demonstration that 150 bp from the 5' end of the barcode is sufficient for species level resolution of bacteria. These short sequences can be identified using established sequence classifiers (QIIME2 feature classifier and RDP classifier), making it simple to integrate cpn60 amplicon sequence identification into existing microbiome analysis pipelines, as recently demonstrated for human skin, vaginal, salivary and stool microbiomes. The purpose of this presentation is to provide a brief overview of cpn60 barcoding resources and applications, and to highlight recent research advances.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s43705-023-00283-z",

                            "abstract": "Culex tritaeniorhynchus is a common household mosquito vector for arboviruses and filarial parasites. To circumvent the development of insecticide resistance, untargeted metatranscriptomics approaches in studying local Culex microbiomes can unveil potential paratransgenic vectors and critical host-microbiome interaction gene targets, serving as foundations for alternative vector biosurveillance and control methods. The metatranscriptomes generated from house mosquitoes collected from Barangays Bayog and Lalakay, Los Ba\u00f1os, Laguna, were pre-processed and host-filtered via fastp, bowtie2, and OpenContami. The clean dscDNA reads were then pooled per barangay and assembled using Trinity and metaSPAdes. Bacterial metatranscripts were retrieved for blastx annotation against the UniProt database, GO and KEGG analysis, and STRING protein-protein interaction network generation. Gram-negative bacterial genera Escherichia, Shigella, and Pseudomonas traceable to the local aquatic and human microflora chiefly contributed to the abundance of transcripts involved in antimicrobial resistance, secondary metabolite transport, aromatic amino acid biosynthesis, cell wall organization, genome regulation, two-component signaling, and iron cofactor metabolism.\nEight candidate prokaryotic genes were selected based on relative abundance and relevance to virulence, xenobiotic metabolism, and other adaptive functions. In both barangays and in select individual mosquitoes, all eight candidate genes were validated via RT-qPCR, exhibiting a wide range of Ct values and melt curve profiles. Genes involved in sustained survival against mosquito innate immune processes (enolases, peptidases, LPS remodelers) posit key players essential for the fitness of a potential paratransgenic vector. Individual variation in RT-qPCR detection results may hint at the relationship between the local and internal environments with respect to Culex microbiomes. As a pioneering metatranscriptomics study in the Philippines, we present potentially culturable paratransgenic vectors for Culex vector control, molecular mechanisms relevant to Culex-microbiome \u201cinteractomics\u201d, and the role of environments in mediating the virulence of Culex parasites and symbionts. Recommendations include bacterial mRNA-enriched extraction protocols, in silico workflow integration with meta-omics datasets, and in vitro validation of culturable bacterial symbionts and their respective genes relevant for vector control.",

                            "abstract": "Allergic diseases affect millions of people worldwide. An increase in their prevalence has been associated with alterations in the gut microbiome, i.e., the microorganisms and their genes within the gastrointestinal tract. Maturation of the infant immune system and gut microbiota occur in parallel; thus, the conformation of the microbiome may determine if tolerant immune pro- gramming arises within the infant. Here we show, using deeply phenotyped participants in the CHILD birth cohort (n = 1115), that there are early-life influences and microbiome features which are uniformly associated with four distinct allergic diagnoses at 5 years: atopic dermatitis (AD, n = 367), asthma (As, n = 165), food allergy (FA, n = 136), and allergic rhinitis (AR, n = 187). In a subset with shotgun metagenomic and metabolomic profiling (n = 589), we discover that impaired 1-year microbiota maturation may be universal to pediatric allergies (AD p = 0.000014; As p = 0.0073; FA p = 0.00083; and AR p = 0.0021). Extending this, we find a core set of functional and metabolic imbalances characterized by compromised mucous integrity, elevated oxida- tive activity, decreased secondary fermentation, and elevated trace amines, to be a significant mediator between microbiota maturation at age 1 year and allergic diagnoses at age 5 years (\u03b2indirect = \u22122.28; p = 0.0020). Microbiota maturation thus provides a focal point to identify deviations from normative development to predict and prevent allergic disease.\n\nLink to publication (OA): https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40336-4",

Here we characterized the DNA signatures of microbes in the blood of 9,770 healthy individuals using sequencing data from multiple cohorts. After filtering for contaminants, we identified 117 microbial species in blood, some of which had DNA signatures of microbial replication. They were primarily commensals associated with the gut (n\u2009=\u200940), mouth (n\u2009=\u200932) and genitourinary tract (n\u2009=\u200918), and were distinct from pathogens detected in hospital blood cultures. No species were detected in 84% of individuals, while the remainder only had a median of one species. Less than 5% of individuals shared the same species, no co-occurrence patterns between different species were observed and no associations between host phenotypes and microbes were found. Overall, these results do not support the hypothesis of a consistent core microbiome endogenous to human blood. Rather, our findings support the transient and sporadic translocation of commensal microbes from other body sites into the bloodstream.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01350-w",

                            "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile colonizes up to 30-40% of community-dwelling adults without causing disease. C. difficile infections (CDIs) are the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the U.S. and typically develop in individuals following disruption of the gut microbiota due to antibiotic or chemotherapy treatments. Further treatment of CDI with antibiotics is not always effective and can lead to antibiotic resistance and recurrent infections (rCDI). The most effective treatment for rCDI is the reestablishment of an intact microbiota via fecal microbiota transplants (FMTs). However, the success of FMTs has been difficult to generalize because the microbial interactions that prevent engraftment and facilitate the successful clearance of C. difficile are still only partially understood. Here we show how microbial community-scale metabolic models (MCMMs) accurately predicted known instances of C. difficile colonization susceptibility or resistance. MCMMs provide detailed mechanistic insights into the ecological interactions that govern C. difficile engraftment, like cross-feeding or competition involving metabolites like succinate, trehalose, and ornithine, which differ from person to person. Indeed, three distinct C. difficile metabolic niches emerge from our MCMMs, two associated with positive growth rates and one that represents non-growth, which are consistently observed across 14,862 individuals from four independent cohorts. Finally, we show how MCMMs can predict personalized engraftment and C. difficile growth suppression for a probiotic cocktail (VE303) designed to replace FMTs for the treatment rCDI. Overall, this powerful modeling approach predicts personalized C. difficile engraftment risk and can be leveraged to assess probiotic treatment efficacy. MCMMs could be extended to better understand personalized engraftment of other opportunistic bacterial pathogens, beneficial probiotic organisms, or more complex microbial consortia.\n\nLink to OA publication: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.28.538771v2.abstract",

                            "abstract": "In anaerobic digestion (AD), a complex microbial community orchestrates the conversion of organic carbon into CO2 and CH4, with anaerobic archaea playing a pivotal role in methanogenesis. However, AD efficiency can be compromised by various factors, including temperature, pH, O2, salt, and ammonia concentration, with ammonia being a major culprit. Ammonia inhibition often arises when processing N-rich organic wastes, leading to potential disruptions in the digestion process. The toxicity of ammonia in AD is governed by its forms, ammonia and ammonium (NH4+), which are in equilibrium based on temperature and pH. Ammonia toxicity imposes challenges by disrupting intracellular pH and demanding additional energy. Free ammonia nitrogen can penetrate cells, interfering with essential cations and affecting metabolic reactions. Accumulated NH4+ can further destabilize intracellular pH and disrupt cation dynamics. Microbes exposed to toxic ammonia may undergo random mutations that confer a survival advantage. These adaptive mutations enable microbes to enhance their tolerance to ammonia toxicity, modifying proteins involved in stress responses. In this study, a stepwise increase in ammonia concentration up to 20 g NH4+-N/L was explored, a range not previously investigated. Genomic heterogeneity within the AD microbiome and the role of variants have received limited attention in prior research. The study introduced an innovative approach, utilizing strain-resolved metagenomics and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) to monitor microbial dynamics. This approach allowed for a comparative analysis of genetic and ecological fluctuations at both species and strain levels in response to ammonia stress. The study aimed to understand the extent to which microbial communities could adapt to ammonia stress and uncover ammonia-tolerant methanogenic consortia. The results unveiled fine-scale evolutionary mechanisms, functional dynamics, and metabolic variations within the microbial community. Specifically, the archaeon Methanoculleus bourgensis vb3066 and the putative syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacterium Acetomicrobium sp. ma133 accumulated through generations positively selected SNVs within genes associated with stress adaptation. Additionally, the study highlighted the presence of multiple coexisting strains within species, indicating an additional layer of diversity beyond the species level. In summary, this study delves into the challenges posed by ammonia inhibition in anaerobic digestion processes. By employing advanced techniques in metagenomics and SNV analysis, it provides a comprehensive understanding of how microbial communities adapt to ammonia stress and offers insights into the selection of ammonia-tolerant microorganisms.",

However, the production of SCFAs can vary widely between individuals consuming the same diet, with lower levels often associated with disease. A mechanistic understanding of this heterogeneity is lacking. We present a microbial community-scale metabolic modeling (MCMM) approach to predict individual-specific SCFA production profiles. We assess the quantitative accuracy of our MCMMs using in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo data. Next, we identify associations between MCMM SCFA predictions and a panel of blood-based clinical chemistries in a large human cohort. Finally, we demonstrate how MCMMs can be leveraged to design personalized dietary, prebiotic, and probiotic interventions that optimize SCFA production in the gut. Our results represent an important advance in engineering gut microbiome functional outputs for precision health and nutrition.",

                            "abstract": "Aquaculture, an ancient practice deeply rooted in traditional knowledge, has experienced a recent surge in growth, presenting sustainability challenges. Sustainable aquaculture hinges on several factors, including the well-being of farmed fish, water quality, and feeds. A crucial step toward enhancing sustainability in aquaculture is the transition from fishmeal to alternative protein sources. Extensive research has focused on assessing innovative feed formulations, particularly their impact on the fish gut microbiome. However, limited studies have investigated the microbiome of the aquaculture built environment and host-environment microbiome interactions.\nHere, we explored the aquaculture ecosystem microbiome when insect-based novel feed formulations are administered. Using 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of microbiomes across water, tank biofilm, fish intestinal mucus, fish cutis, and feed samples.\nOur results showed that overall, water and the aquaculture built environment were characterised by an astounding microbial diversity.\nCore microbiome analysis unveiled a highly reduced core shared among all sample sources, in both the control and novel feed test groups.\nNetwork analysis demonstrated sample clustering based on sample source, with no significant variations tied to the feed formulation. Consequently, the different diets did not appear to impact the environment (water and tank biofilm) and fish (cutis and intestinal mucus) microbiomes. For a more detailed examination of the feed's contribution, we conducted a differential abundance analysis, revealing distinct enrichment/depletion of specific taxa when comparing the control to the insect-based diet group.\nThe results of this study highlight how the aquaculture environment is a unique source of microbes, able to colonise fish. Omic exploration of the water-fish interface exposes patterns that are otherwise undetected: subtle but significant differences in the abundance of specific taxa are exerted by feed. A comprehensive grasp of aquaculture ecosystems as holobiomes is vital to design the built environment and modulate the microbial communities that are hosted for sustainable aquaculture.",

However, the ecological forces that drive diversity reduction in disease states remain unclear, rendering it difficult to ascertain the role of the microbiota in disease emergence or severity. One hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is that microbial diversity is diminished simply because disease states select for microbial populations that are more fit to survive environmental stress caused by inflammation or other host factors. The purpose of this talk is to demonstrate how such microbes with 'high metabolic independence', characterized by the genomic presence of a set of key metabolic modules for the synthesis of essential nutrients dominate gut environments under stress. This paradigm depicts microbes as bystanders by default, rather than perpetrators or drivers of noncommunicable human diseases, and provides an ecological framework to explain the frequently observed reduction in microbial diversity associated with IBD and other noncommunicable human diseases and disorders.\n\nLinks to two OA papers and an OA perspective that may be appropriate material for further reading into this topic:\nWatson, Fuessel, Veseli et al (2023): https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-023-02924-x\nVeseli et al (2023): https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/89862\nMarcelino (2023): https://elifesciences.org/articles/92319",

Besides, compared to term infants, premature infants often receive antibiotics to treat infections and probiotics to restore optimal gut microbiota. How GA, antibiotics, and probiotics modulate the microbiota\u2019s core characteristics, gut resistome and mobilome, remains nascent. Methods: We analysed metagenomic data from a longitudinal observational study in six Norwegian neonatal intensive care units to describe the bacterial microbiota of infants of varying GA and receiving different treatments. The cohort consisted of probiotic-supplemented and antibiotic-exposed extremely preterm infants (n = 29), antibiotic-exposed very preterm (n = 25), antibiotic-unexposed very preterm (n = 8), and antibiotic-unexposed full-term (n = 10) infants. The stool samples were collected on days of life 7, 28, 120, and 365, and DNA extraction was followed by shotgun metagenome sequencing and bioinformatical analysis. Findings: The top predictors of microbiota maturation were hospitalisation length and GA. Probiotic administration rendered the gut microbiota and resistome of extremely preterm infants more alike to term infants on day 7 and ameliorated GA-driven loss of microbiota interconnectivity and stability. GA, hospitalisation, and both microbiota-modifying treatments (antibiotics and probiotics) contributed to an elevated carriage of mobile genetic elements in preterm infants compared to term controls. Finally, Escherichia coli was associated with the highest number of antibiotic-resistance genes, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella aerogenes. Interpretation: Prolonged hospitalisation, antibiotics, and probiotic intervention contribute to dynamic alterations in resistome and mobilome, gut microbiota characteristics relevant to infection risk.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(23)00178-0/fulltext",

The immune system controls our interaction with the microbial world, and the microbial communities in our bodies are central to modulating the immune response. Changes in the human microbiome and their metabolism have substantial influence on atopy, neurological disorders, metabolic disorders, and a range of complex conditions and disease states. Diet is incredibly important in shaping human health and the microbiome, altering both composition and metabolic activity, resulting in changes in immune, endocrine, and neurological systems. Microbiome-Wide Association Studies (MWAS) combined with novel quantitative multi-omic approaches are enabling us to use AI techniques to determine personalized responses to nutrition that drive diseases states and treatment efficacy.

Accumulating evidence proposes an important role of gut microbiota in neurodevelopmental disorders via microbiota-gut-brain axis. In a neonatal rat model of IESS, we show both the ketogenic diet and antibiotic administration to reduce seizure frequency and to be associated with improved developmental outcomes. Seizure reductions were accompanied by specific gut microbial alterations including increases in Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis. Mimicking the fecal microbial alterations in a targeted probiotic, we administered these species in a 5:1 ratio. Probiotic administration reduced seizures and improved locomotor activities in control diet-fed animals, similar to KD-fed animals while a negative control (Ligilactobacillus salivarius) had no impact. These results suggest that a targeted microbiota manipulation could improve behavior outcome in infantile epilepsy and provides new insights into microbiota manipulation as a therapeutic avenue for neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(22)00017-2/fulltext",

Epidemiologists first analyzed wastewater to track outbreaks of poliovirus decades ago, but so-called wastewater-based epidemiology was reinvigorated to monitor SARS-CoV-2 levels while bypassing the difficulties and pit falls of individual testing. Current approaches overlook the activity of most human viruses and preclude a deeper understanding of human virome community dynamics. Here, we conduct a comprehensive sequencing-based analysis of 363 longitudinal wastewater samples from ten distinct sites in two major cities. Critical to detection is the use of a viral probe capture set targeting thousands of viral species or variants. Over 450 distinct pathogenic viruses from 28 viral families are observed, most of which have never been detected in such samples. Sequencing reads of established pathogens and emerging viruses correlate to clinical data sets of SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus, and monkeypox viruses, outlining the public health utility of this approach. Viral communities are tightly organized by space and time. Finally, the most abundant human viruses yield sequence variant information consistent with regional spread and evolution. We reveal the viral landscape of human wastewater and its potential to improve our understanding of outbreaks, transmission, and its effects on overall population health.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-42064-1",

                            "abstract": "Microbiome scientists critically need modern tools to explore and analyze microbial evolution. Often this involves studying the evolution of microbial genomes as a whole. However, different genes in a single genome can be subject to different evolutionary pressures, which can result in distinct gene-level evolutionary histories. To address this challenge, we propose to treat estimated gene-level phylogenies as data objects, and present an interactive method for the analysis of a collection of gene phylogenies. We use a local linear approximation of phylogenetic tree space to visualize estimated gene trees as points in low-dimensional Euclidean space, and address important practical limitations of existing related approaches, allowing an intuitive visualization of complex data objects. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed approach through microbial data analyses, including by identifying outlying gene histories in strains of Prevotella, and by contrasting Streptococcus phylogenies estimated using different gene sets. Our method is available as an open-source R package, and assists with estimating, visualizing, and interacting with a collection of bacterial gene phylogenies.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxad025",

                            "abstract": "Commensal protists have historically been overlooked as members of the gut microbiota, but recent studies have highlighted the dominant effects of these commensals on the gut ecosystem. In particular, protists in the Parabasalia phylum reshape the intestinal immune landscape and influence host susceptibility to both infectious and inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanisms used by these protists to shape the gut environment remain poorly understood. Here, we identify a new species of commensal parabasalid in the mouse intestine, Tritrichomonas casperi. We find that metabolic differences between T. casperi and the closely related species Tritrichomonas musculis modulate their effects on host immunity and determine their ecological niche within the microbiota. First, we investigate metabolic output of these commensal parabasalids using genomic and metabolomic analysis. This reveals species-level differences in excretion of the tuft cell activating metabolite succinate, which causes differential remodeling of the immune system in the small intestine. Next, we investigate protist metabolic input by manipulating dietary fiber intake, as well as developing in vitro culture. This reveals that whereas T. musculis preferentially relies on dietary polysaccharides, T. casperi uses host mucus glycans as a carbon source. These carbon source preferences lead to differential competition with commensal bacteria in the intestine, including Bacteroidales spp. and Akkermansia muciniphila. These trans-kingdom interactions can in turn suppress protist-induced intestinal immune responses in a diet-dependent manner. Finally, we explore the diversity of commensal protists in humans by examining parabasalids in the microbiomes of both industrialized and non-industrialized populations. We identify multiple new species of commensal parabasalids in the microbiomes of non-industrialized populations, including novel human-associated tritrichomonads that are closely related T. musculis and T. casperi. Altogether, our findings elucidate how commensal parabasalid metabolism acts as a focal point for complex interactions with the host immune system, commensal bacteria, and diet, to impact intestinal immunity and host health.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.26.505490v2",

                            "abstract": "In ecological and conservation studies, responsible researchers strive to obtain rich data while minimizing disturbance to wildlife and ecosystems. We assessed if samples collected noninvasively, in this case, from common cranes (Grus grus), can be used for fecal microbiome research, comparing microbiota of noninvasively collected fecal samples to those collected from trapped common cranes at the same sites over the same period.\n\nWe found significant differences in fecal microbial composition (alpha and beta diversity), which likely did not result from noninvasive samples\u2019 exposure to soil contaminants, as assessed by comparing bacterial oxygen use profiles. Differences might result from trapped birds\u2019 exposure to sedatives or stress. We conclude that if all samples are collected in the same manner, comparative analyses are valid, and noninvasive sampling may better represent host fecal microbiota because there are no trapping effects.\n\nTo illustrate this point, combining movement data from GPS-tagged cranes with noninvasively sampled fecal microbiota samples of birds spatiotemporally overlapping with the tagged birds, we find evidence that supports the role of diet in structuring bacterial communities. We also show that the wild bird gut microbiota undergoes not only seasonal shifts but is also affected by management schemes and local agricultural practices.\n\nExperiments with fresh and delayed sample collection can elucidate effects of environmental exposures on microbiota. Further, controlled tests of stressing or sedation may unravel how trapping affects wildlife microbiota, but our application already shows how valuable this method can be.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1755-0998.13708",

The most common clinical presentation are abdominal tumours. An altered gut microbiome composition has been linked to multiple cancer types, and reported in murine models of neuroblastoma. However, whether children with neuroblastoma display alterations in gut microbiome composition remains unexplored.\n\nHere, we assessed gut microbiome composition by shotgun metagenomic profiling in an observational cross-sectional study on 288 individuals, consisting of patients with a diagnosis of neuroblastoma at disease onset (N=63), healthy controls matching the patients on the main covariates of microbiome composition (N=94), healthy siblings of the patients (N=13), mothers of patients (N=59), and mothers of the controls (N=59). We examined taxonomic and functional microbiome composition and mother-infant strain transmission patterns. Patients with neuroblastoma displayed alterations in gut microbiome composition characterised by reduced microbiome richness, decreased relative abundances of 18 species (including Phocaeicola dorei and Bifidobacterium bifidum), enriched protein fermentation and reduced carbohydrate fermentation potential. Using machine learning, we could successfully discriminate patients from controls (AUC = 82%). Healthy siblings did not display such alterations but resembled the healthy control group. No significant differences in maternal microbiome composition nor mother-to-offspring transmission were detected.\n\nTherefore, the alterations in taxonomic and functional gut microbiome composition we described in patients with neuroblastoma, cannot be traced to differential maternal seeding and might arise subsequently.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(23)00483-8/fulltext",

However, existing binning methods face challenges in practical applications due to the diversity of data types and the difficulties in efficiently integrating heterogeneous information. Here, we introduce COMEBin, a binning method based on contrastive multi-view representation learning. COMEBin utilizes data augmentation to generate multiple fragments (views) of each contig and obtains high-quality embeddings of heterogeneous features (sequence coverage and k-mer distribution) through contrastive learning. Experimental results on multiple simulated and real datasets demonstrate that COMEBin outperforms state-of-the-art binning methods, particularly in recovering near-complete genomes from real environmental samples. COMEBin outperforms other binning methods remarkably when integrated into metagenomic analysis pipelines, including the recovery of potentially pathogenic antibiotic-resistant bacteria (PARB) and moderate or higher quality bins containing potential biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs).\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44290-z",

In women, the urinary microbiome has been associated with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) such as urge urinary incontinence. However, similar studies have not been undertaken in large cohorts of men. Here we examine the urinary microbiome and its association with LUTS in a subset of 500 men aged 65 to 90 years from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) study. We identified significant associations between benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), age, and body mass index (BMI) with several diversity metrics. Our analysis revealed complex relationships between BMI, BPH, LUTS, and alpha diversity which give insight into the intricate dynamics of the urinary microbiome. By beginning to uncover the interrelationships of BPH, BMI, LUTS, and the urinary microbiome, these results can inform future study design to better understand the heterogeneity of the male urinary microbiome.",

                            "abstract": "The human gut microbiome is composed of a highly diverse consortia of species which are continually evolving within and across hosts. The ability to identify adaptations common to many host gut microbiomes would not only reveal shared selection pressures across hosts, but also key drivers of functional differentiation of the microbiome that may affect community structure and host traits. However, to date there has not been a systematic scan for adaptations that have spread across host microbiomes. Here, we develop a novel selection scan statistic, named the integrated linkage disequilibrium score (iLDS), that can detect the spread of adaptive haplotypes across host microbiomes via migration and horizontal gene transfer. Specifically, iLDS leverages signals of hitchhiking of deleterious variants with the beneficial variant, a common feature of adaptive evolution. We find that iLDS is capable of detecting simulated and known cases of selection, and moreover is robust to potential confounders that can also elevate LD. Application of the statistic to \u223c20 common commensal gut species from a large cohort of healthy, Western adults reveals pervasive spread of selected alleles across human microbiomes mediated by horizontal gene transfer. Among the candidate selective sweeps recovered by iLDS is an enrichment for genes involved in the metabolism of maltodextrin, a synthetic starch that has recently become a widespread component of Western diets. In summary, we demonstrate that selective sweeps across host microbiomes are a common feature of the evolution of the human gut microbiome.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.22.573162v1",

We find that Obelisks form their own distinct phylogenetic group with no detectable sequence or structural similarity to known biological agents. Further, Obelisks are prevalent in tested human microbiome metatranscriptomes with representatives detected in about 7% of analysed stool metatranscriptomes (29/440) and in about 50% of analysed oral metatranscriptomes (17/32). Obelisk compositions appear to differ between the anatomic sites and are capable of persisting in individuals, with continued presence over 300 days observed in one case. Large scale searches identified 29,959 Obelisks (clustered at 90% nucleotide identity), with examples from all seven continents and in diverse ecological niches. From this search, a subset of Obelisks are identified to code for Obelisk-specific variants of the hammerhead type-III self-cleaving ribozyme. Lastly, we identified one case of a bacterial species (Streptococcus sanguinis) in which a subset of defined laboratory strains harboured a specific Obelisk RNA population. As such, Obelisks comprise a class of diverse RNAs that have colonised, and gone unnoticed in, human, and global microbiomes.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.20.576352v1",

                            "abstract": "Introduction: Diarrhea claims about 500,000 lives annually among children under five years of age and about 90% of those deaths occur in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Childhood mortality due to acute diarrhea (AD; less than 7 days of duration) is decreasing, but prolonged (ProD; 7-13 days of duration) and persistent (PD; more than 14 days of duration) diarrhea combined (ProPD) are responsible for increased morbidity and mortality in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs).\nObjectives: This study aimed to characterize the gut microbiota (GM) composition of children with acute diarrhea (AD) and prolonged or persistent diarrhea (ProPD) by comparing GM composition between these two groups and with non-diarrheal controls in a case-control study.\nMethods: The study included fecal samples from 1321 children 0-59 months old. After preprocessing based on sequencing depth, we analyzed the GM of 1313 children comparing 554 AD cases, 95 ProPD cases, and 663 frequency matched, non-diarrheal controls. All children were enrolled from Jimma, Ethiopia. The GM composition was determined using 16S rRNA gene (V4 region) amplicon sequencing. The observed zero-radius Operational Taxonomic Units (zOTUs) and Shannon diversity index were assessed, and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity metrics were generated and differences between groups evaluated by PERMANOVA. DESeq2 was used to determine taxa being differentially abundant between diarrhea subcategories and non-diarrheal controls.\nResults: All diarrhea cases (AD and ProPD) combined and each group separately were associated with a decrease in bacterial diversity compared to non-diarrheal controls. Relative to non-diarrheal controls, the GM of children with AD or ProPD was enriched in Escherichia spp., Campylobacter spp., and Streptococcus spp. The GM of children with AD or ProPD was characterized by a decreased relative abundance of Prevotella copri, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Dialister succinatiphilus compared to non-diarrheal controls. Similarly, compared to AD cases, ProPD cases were characterized by a decreased relative abundance of important gut commensals such as F. prausnitzii, Akkermansia muciniphila, Eubacterium hadrum and Blautia spp.\nConclusion: The GM of children with AD and ProPD was enriched in putative pathogens as well as facultative anaerobes, while obligate anaerobes were reduced. The GM of children with ProPD was characterized by a more pronounced reduction of obligate anaerobic gut commensals compared to AD, suggesting that prolonged duration of diarrhea is accompanied by a depletion of healthy gut commensals. This indicates a potential role for targeted dietary supplements to restore gut eubiosis and/ or the use of next generation probiotics to improve ProPD treatment.",

In this study, our objective was to evaluate whether a selenium-rich postbiotic composed of whole-cell Saccharomyces cerevisiae ABB S12, Kluyveromyces marxianus ABB S8 and Saccharomyces boulardii ABB S3 yeast strains, can act as provider of selenium to enhance the function of the human immune system after oral intake.\nMethods and findings: A total of 15 volunteers were enrolled in a 28-day clinical study in which they complemented their normal diets with a daily dose of a novel selenium food supplement, \u201cpostbiotic immune\u201d. Selenium levels in plasma were quantified by ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay), and the proliferation and activation of different subsets of lymphocytes isolated from PBMC\u2019s (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells) were assessed by flow cytometry using different cell markers. At the end of the study, we observed a higher proliferative capacity of total lymphocytes and specifically, of CD16+ lymphocytes (natural killer cells), upon stimulation with the CD3 and CD28 antibodies mimicking cell activation in vitro. Interestingly, we did not observe an increase in the activation of the lymphocyte subsets CD4+ (T helper cells) but CD16+, indicating that that there was a specific activation of natural killer cells.\nConclusions: Altogether, our results suggest that orally ingested \u201dPostbiotic immune\u201d primes the human immune system to elicit a faster and more efficient immune response through the specific activation of natural killer cells.\n\nLink to publication: \nhttps://nutraceuticals.imedpub.com/a-three-strain-postbiotic-mix-improves-the-immune-system-function-after-oral-intake-for-28days.php?aid=52017",

This leaves a tremendous gap in translating microbiome science to personalized biomarkers and therapies. While multi-omic studies represent a promising means of prioritizing leads for validation, this still leaves thousands of molecular targets for most phenotypes of interest. The Human Microbiome Bioactives Resource (HMBR) provides a set of computational and experimental protocols for accelerating these tasks, including the identification of \u201cbioactive\u201d strains, microbial proteins, and chemical products from the human gut, as well as newly predicting function for uncharacterized genes and metabolites. These have proven effective in applications as diverse as the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD, in a meta-analysis spanning over 8,700 metagenomes) or companion animal nutrition (employing almost 2,500 canine and feline gut samples). In an end-to-end example linking metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metabolomics, inflammation phenotypes, and drug treatment, we have specifically identified a subset of microbial gene families responsible for 5-ASA inactivation, the leading cause of progression to second-line treatments in IBD. Together, this family of approaches provides multiple new avenues for identifying molecular activities responsible for microbiome-phenotype associations.",

                            "abstract": "The human gut microbiota is influenced by various factors, including health status and environmental conditions, yet considerable inter-individual differences remain unexplained. Previous studies identified that the gut microbiota of men who have sex with men (MSM) is distinct from that of non-MSM. Here, we reveal through species-level microbiota analysis using shotgun metagenomics that the gut microbiota of many MSM with Western origin resembles gut microbial communities of non-Westernized populations. Specifically, MSM gut microbiomes are frequently dominated by members of the Prevotellaceae family, including co-colonization of species from the Segatella copri complex and unknown Prevotellaceae members. Questionnaire-based analysis exploring inter-individual differences in MSM links specific sexual practices to microbiota composition. Moreover, machine learning identifies microbial features associated with sexual activities in MSM. Together, this study shows associations of sexual activities with gut microbiome alterations in MSM, which may have a large impact on population-based microbiota studies.\n\nLink to publication: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379124000491",

                            "abstract": "Microbiome 16S rRNA studies have examined diverse habitats, including oceans, soil, plants, animals, and large cross-sectional human studies. However, finding commonalities between different experiments, habitats, or conditions is very difficult due to technical issues related to using different primer pairs and relying on taxonomy for scientific reporting. Hence, grosso modo, the 16S rRNA microbiome literature has not been integrated into a collaborative body of knowledge. It often comprises effectively isolated studies, where researchers may be completely unaware of commonalities between their findings and those in other studies, especially across different niches or habitats. In the past five years, we have created dbBact (www.dbbact.org), a knowledge base, to bridge this gap and lay the groundwork for gaining core pan-microbiome insights. Briefly, amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) from datasets of published papers are manually analyzed, and bacterial sequences associated with experimental conditions are uploaded to dbBact, together with ontology-based characterizations (e.g., \u201cthe abundance of sequence ACTGGA\u2026 was higher in fecal samples of horses with colitis compared to healthy controls in California\u201d). To date, dbBact contains data from more than 1000 published studies across diverse habitats, spanning ~370,000 unique 16S rRNA ASVs, with approximately 1,500,000 sequence-to-phenotype associations. We demonstrated how dbBact provides many types of novel hypotheses that cannot be formulated by standard methods (Amir et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 2023). We will show how dbBact may be (1) applied as part of microbiome research in any niche; (2) allow a new type of meta-analysis; and (3) be harnessed to answer ecological questions. \n\nLink to publication: https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/51/13/6593/7199329?login=true",

Gut microbiota may partially mediate this association and could be potential targets for intervention; however, its role is understudied. We included 1,592 infants from the Canadian Healthy Infants Longitudinal Development Cohort. Data on environmental exposure and lifestyle factors were collected prenatally and throughout the first three years. Weight outcomes were measured at one and three years of age. Stool samples collected at 3 and 12\u2009months were analyzed by sequencing the V4 region of 16S rRNA to profile microbial compositions and magnetic resonance spectroscopy to quantify the metabolites. We showed that quitting smoking during pregnancy did not lower the risk of offspring being overweight. However, exclusive breastfeeding until the third month of age may alleviate these risks. We also reported that maternal smoking during pregnancy significantly increased Firmicutes abundance and diversity. We further revealed that Firmicutes diversity mediates the elevated risk of childhood overweight and obesity linked to maternal prenatal smoking. This effect possibly occurs through excessive microbial butyrate production. These findings add to the evidence that women should quit smoking before their pregnancies to prevent microbiome-mediated childhood overweight and obesity risk, and indicate the potential obesogenic role of excessive butyrate production in early life.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2024.2323234",

Engineered biosensing bacteria outfitted with such circuits can potentially probe the human gut microbiome to prevent, diagnose, or treat disease. To provide robust biocontainment for engineered bacteria, we devised a Cas9-assisted auxotrophic biocontainment system combining thymidine auxotrophy, an Engineered Riboregulator (ER) for controlled gene expression, and a CRISPR Device (CD). The CD prevents the engineered bacteria from acquiring thyA via horizontal gene transfer, which would disrupt the biocontainment system, and inhibits the spread of genetic elements by killing bacteria harboring the gene cassette. This system tunably controlled gene expression in the human gut commensal bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, prevented escape from thymidine auxotrophy, and blocked transgene dissemination. These capabilities were validated in vitro and in vivo. This biocontainment system exemplifies a powerful strategy for bringing genetically engineered microorganisms safely into biomedicine.\n\nLink to OA paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-45893-w",

While Bacteroidales strains and species are genomically and functionally diverse, order-wide comparative analyses are lacking. We cultured and sequenced the genomes of 408 Bacteroidales isolates from healthy human donors representing nine genera and 35 species and performed comparative genomic, gene-specific, mobile gene, and metabolomic analyses. Families, genera, and species could be grouped based on many distinctive features. However, we also show extensive DNA transfer between diverse families, allowing for shared traits and strain evolution. Inter- and intra-specific diversity is also apparent in the metabolomic profiling studies. This highly characterized and diverse Bacteroidales culture collection with strain-resolved genomic and metabolomic analyses can serve as a resource to facilitate informed selection of strains for microbiome reconstitution.",

However, we have shown that shifts in the ecological properties of the skin microbiome are significantly associated with aging, skin disease, disease severity, and monogenic skin and immune disorders.

Predicting the colonization of exogenous species in complex communities remains a fundamental challenge in microbial ecology, mainly due to our limited knowledge of the diverse mechanisms governing microbial dynamics. Here, we propose a data-driven approach independent of any dynamics model to predict colonization outcomes of exogenous species from the baseline compositions of microbial communities. We systematically validate this approach using synthetic data, finding that machine learning models can predict not only the binary colonization outcome but also the post-invasion steady-state abundance of the invading species. Then we conduct colonization experiments for commensal gut bacteria species Enterococcus faecium and Akkermansia muciniphila in hundreds of human stool-derived in vitro microbial communities, confirming that the data-driven approaches can predict the colonization outcomes in experiments. Furthermore, we find that while most resident species are predicted to have a weak negative impact on the colonization of exogenous species, strongly interacting species could significantly alter the colonization outcomes, e.g., Enterococcus faecalis inhibits the invasion of E. faecium invasion. The presented results suggest that the data-driven approaches are powerful tools to inform the ecology and management of microbial communities.",

Recently, systematic studies have shown that smORFs are widely distributed ecologically and perform diverse functions. However, little is known about the distribution and role of smORFs in the global microbiome. Therefore, we constructed the global microbial smORFs catalogue (GMSC) from 63,410 publicly-available metagenomes across 72 distinct habitats and 87,920 high-quality isolated microbial genomes. GMSC (available at https://gmsc.big-data-biology.org/) contains 964,970,496 non-redundant smORFs, the majority of which are novel. We found that archaea harbor more small proteins than bacteria (as a fraction of their genomes). To enable the use of this resource, we provide a tool called GMSC-mapper that can identify and annotate reliable smORFs from microbial genomes and metagenomes. The resource shows an immense and underexplored diversity of smORFs and can be used to research the presence, distribution, and role of smORFs at the global scale.",

As the microbiome varies across geographies and lifestyles, it is of utmost importance to fill these \u201cwhite gaps\u201d and include also with communities and age groups that did not participate in these efforts to date. Many of these communities are- for different reasons- considered as vulnerable populations and including them in microbiome research thus poses many important ethical questions. In this presentation, I aim to give examples of ethical questions and constraints that arise when working on the microbiome of vulnerable populations. Giving examples from our research on the microbiome of undernourished children and their families from the Global South over the last years, I aim to stimulate discussion and reflection on these questions, to foster even better and more inclusive collaborations across cultures, disciplines and social structures in the future.",

In addition, the limited research on other understudied populations is not without its ethical quandaries either. In this presentation, I discuss and clarify these ethical issues by disentangling these into 3 main subsets: European and North American bias, cultural insensitivity, and lack of meaningful collaboration and inclusion. Thereafter, I propose an overall approach to solving these quandaries by introducing the notion of radical interdisciplinary co-laboration, in which different academic and non-academic stakeholders mediate their knowledges and labor together in studying human microbiomes. I will elicit how the proposed approach will render microbiome science more ethical and at the same time render the very science of microbiomes more precise and rigorous.",

However, populations from low- and middle-income countries, which represent \u223c84% of the world population, have been excluded from large-scale gut microbiome research. Here, we present the AWI-Gen 2 Microbiome Project, a cross-sectional gut microbiome study sampling 1,803 women from Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa. By intensively engaging with communities that range from rural and horticultural to urban informal settlements and post-industrial, we capture population diversity that represents a far greater breadth of the world\u2019s population. Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we find that study site explains substantially more microbial variation than disease status. We identify taxa with strong geographic and lifestyle associations, including loss of Treponema and Cryptobacteroides species and gain of Bifidobacterium species in urban populations. We uncover a wealth of prokaryotic and viral novelty, including 1,005 new bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes, and identify phylogeography signatures in Treponema succinifaciens. Finally, we find a microbiome signature of HIV infection that is defined by several taxa not previously associated with HIV, including Dysosmobacter welbionis and Enterocloster sp. This study represents the largest population-representative survey of gut metagenomes of African individuals to date, and paired with extensive clinical biomarkers, demographic data, and lifestyle information, provides extensive opportunity for microbiome-related discovery and research.\n\nLink to preprint: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.13.584859v1",

Increasingly, research is being directed towards remote countries or communities where microbiome data were previously non-existent, and this is sometimes accompanied by challenges in communication, recruiting participants, collecting samples, and even transporting and storing these samples. The Leke project is an Isala sister project carried out in Cameroon which aims to map the vaginal microbiome of healthy women and break the taboo around vaginal health. Particularly in the Leke project, we raised awareness about vaginal health and healthy practices in remote communities by including in the conversation to men and women. In this presentation, we will explain the challenges we faced and how we overcame them to research the vaginal microbiome.\n\nLink to Josiane\u2019s blog about the project: https://isala.be/en/the-leke-project-a-journey-to-the-isala-sister-project-in-cameroon/",

Today, Isala has inspired more than ten projects in other countries, united under the mission to improve women's health through investigation of the vaginal microbiome. This talk presents Marie, the Swiss sister project, and the first official collaboration between projects from the Isala sisterhood: Laura, Leke, Marie, and Isala. This collaboration interlinks fundamental biomedical research with social sciences methodologies to generate research evidence on the impact of menstrual products on the vaginal microbiome, complemented with women\u2019s views, perceptions, and concerns about menstrual health management. Hand in hand with international policymakers, local organizations and the private sector, the four sisters want to bring knowledge of the impact of menstrual products on the vaginal microbiome to the current agenda on menstrual health.\n\nLink: https://isala.be/en/the-isala-sisterhood-lets-write-history-together/",
