However, the influence of surgery for CRC treatment on the gut microbiome and metabolites and how it relates to CRC risk in postoperative CRC patients remain partially understood. Here, we collected 170 fecal samples from 85 CRC patients pre- and approximately 1 year postsurgery and performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing and capillary electrophoresis-time of flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS)-based metabolomics analyses to characterize alterations between pre- and postsurgery. We determined that the relative abundance of 114 species was altered postsurgery (P lower than 0.005). CRC-associated species, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, were decreased postsurgery.

Abstract: Accumulating evidence indicates that the gut microbiome and metabolites are associated with colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the influence of surgery for CRC treatment on the gut microbiome and metabolites and how it relates to CRC risk in postoperative CRC patients remain partially understood. Here, we collected 170 fecal samples from 85 CRC patients pre- and approximately 1 year postsurgery and performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing and capillary electrophoresis-time of flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS)-based metabolomics analyses to characterize alterations between pre- and postsurgery. We determined that the relative abundance of 114 species was altered postsurgery (P lower than 0.005). CRC-associated species, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, were decreased postsurgery. On the other hand, Clostridium scindens, carcinogenesis-associated deoxycholate (DCA)-producing species, and its biotransformed genes (bai operon) were increased postsurgery. The concentration of 60 fecal metabolites was also altered postsurgery (P lower than 0.005). Two bile acids, cholate and DCA, were increased postsurgery. We developed methods to estimate postoperative CRC risk based on the gut microbiome and metabolomic compositions using a random forest machine-learning algorithm that classifies large adenoma or early-stage CRC and healthy controls from publicly available data sets. We applied methods to preoperative samples and then compared the estimated CRC risk between the two groups according to the presence of large adenoma or tumors 5 years postsurgery (P lower than 0.05). Overall, our results show that the gut microbiome and metabolites dynamically change from pre- to postsurgery. In postoperative CRC patients, potential CRC risk derived from gut microbiome and metabolites still remains, which indicates the importance of follow-up assessments.

A signature represents statistically different bacterial taxa identified in a given study and represents a summary of a study’s findings. These signatures can be assessed across studies for consistency and agreement. BugSigDB is a manually curated database of microbial signatures collected from published microbiome differential abundance studies. Key information for each study is curated including study design, sample size, participant information, laboratory methods, and statistical methods in a structured, standardized format. BugSigDB is open source and available for researchers to use and contribute to. As of January 11th, 2022 it contains 2,107 microbial signatures curated from 522 published microbiome research articles. We present an applied example of use of BugSigDB gut microbiome signatures for COVID-19. Analysis of 132 signatures from 32 studies of COVID-19 and the gut microbiome reveal significant co-occurrence of several bacterial taxa within the phylum Firmicutes along with Actinobacteria, Bacteriodetes, and Proteobacteria (Figure 1). Across these studies, the genera Bacteroides and Alistipes were statistically found to be in decreased abundance among COVID-19 patients. bugsigdbr, an accompanying open source R/Bioconductor package, provides signatures and accompanying data downloads in a tidy data format.

Abstract: Most microbiome studies report “signatures” of differentially abundant microbial taxa for a disease or exposure of interest, but heterogeneity in how complex methods and results are reported make comparisons between studies difficult. A signature represents statistically different bacterial taxa identified in a given study and represents a summary of a study’s findings. These signatures can be assessed across studies for consistency and agreement. BugSigDB is a manually curated database of microbial signatures collected from published microbiome differential abundance studies. Key information for each study is curated including study design, sample size, participant information, laboratory methods, and statistical methods in a structured, standardized format. BugSigDB is open source and available for researchers to use and contribute to. As of January 11th, 2022 it contains 2,107 microbial signatures curated from 522 published microbiome research articles. We present an applied example of use of BugSigDB gut microbiome signatures for COVID-19. Analysis of 132 signatures from 32 studies of COVID-19 and the gut microbiome reveal significant co-occurrence of several bacterial taxa within the phylum Firmicutes along with Actinobacteria, Bacteriodetes, and Proteobacteria (Figure 1). Across these studies, the genera Bacteroides and Alistipes were statistically found to be in decreased abundance among COVID-19 patients. bugsigdbr, an accompanying open source R/Bioconductor package, provides signatures and accompanying data downloads in a tidy data format. Data can also be accessed via a semantic wiki web interface at https://bugsigdb.org. Together, they allow for efficient systematic analysis of findings from microbiome studies across a variety of diseases and conditions of interest."

While functional genomics can generate large gene-to-phenotype datasets to accelerate gene discovery, their applications to study gut anaerobes have been limited. For instance, most gain-of-function screens of gut bacterial genes have been performed in an aerobic host and included a small number of conditions. To address these challenges, we developed a strategy to barcode expression libraries for high-throughput interrogation of gene functions in competitive fitness assays. We demonstrate the power of this approach to uncover novel phenotypes for uncharacterized genes using pooled libraries constructed from a diverse set of gut Bacteroidales expressed in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. We identified new roles in carbohydrate metabolism for nine proteins, including enzymes, transporters, a regulator, and hypothetical proteins from mobile genetic elements. This approach can be readily applied to other organisms and additional phenotypic assays.

Huang,https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=yyh,"Bacteria and bacterial viruses (phages) are the most abundant members of the gut microbiota and are important drivers of human health. Despite the large amounts of sequencing and -omics data available on the human gut microbiome, it remains challenging to identify the molecular mechanism underlying associations between specific microbes and disease states. A major barrier in the field is our inability to readily infer function from sequencing data since microbes are extremely diverse with poorly annotated genomes. Furthermore, predicting gene functions often requires mechanistic knowledge of the protein family and phenotypic data, which can be difficult to obtain. To address these challenges, the Huang lab uses multidisciplinary approaches including functional genomics, genetics, biochemistry, and bioinformatics to study new pathways encoded in gut bacteria and phages. We developed a high-throughput functional genomics platform, Barcoded Overexpression BActerial Shotgun Library Sequencing (Boba-seq), to interrogate gene functions at scale in a prominent group of gut anaerobes, Bacteroidales. These bacteria are highly abundant in the gut and are mostly associated with health due to their diverse repertoires of metabolic pathways and ability to access host-recalcitrant polysaccharides. DNA barcoding reduces the cost and increases the throughput of genome-wide genetic screens drastically. A major focus of the lab is to elucidate new roles and functions of genes important for nutrient acquisition and stress tolerance. We are also interested in identifying factors involved in bacteria-phage interactions. Phages are important members of the gut microbiota, but how they influence bacterial physiology and composition remains poorly understood. The overarching goal in the lab is to advance our fundamental knowledge of molecular mechanisms underlying host-microbe-phage interactions. This will help us to better understand and predict the composition and functions of microbial communities under constant selections from microbial, host, and environmental factors.",Department of Microbiology and Immunology,Assistant Professor,grid.273335.3,https://i.imgur.com/jlnqjDg.jpeg,"Title of the presentation: ""Functional screens of barcoded expression libraries uncover new gene functions in carbon utilization among gut Bacteroidales""

The urogenital microbiome is a key component of the urinary environment. However, changes in the urogenital microbiome underlying rUTI susceptibility are unknown. Here, we perform shotgun metagenomics and advanced culture on urine from a controlled cohort of postmenopausal women to identify urogenital microbiome compositional and function changes linked to rUTI susceptibility. We identify candidate taxonomic biomarkers of rUTI susceptibility in postmenopausal women and an enrichment of lactobacilli in postmenopausal women taking estrogen hormone therapy. We find robust correlations between Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and urinary estrogens in women without urinary tract infection (UTI) history. Functional analyses reveal distinct metabolic and antimicrobial resistance gene (ARG) signatures associated with rUTI. Importantly, we find that ARGs are enriched in the urogenital microbiomes of women with rUTI history independent of current UTI status.

Before stem-cell infusion, recipients undergo a conditioning regimen with chemo/radiotherapy and immunosuppressants, requiring the use of antibiotics to treat and prevent infections. This regimen promotes drastic alterations in the recipient′s microbiotas, including the oral microbiota, which have been associated with allo-HSCT complications and poor outcomes. However, long-term longitudinal studies on the oral microbiota of allo-HSCT recipients are scarce and disregard the existence of distinct microbiotas within the oral cavity. Here, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the microbiota dynamics (during and after allo-HSCT) of 31 allo-HSCT recipients at 3 oral sites (gingival crevicular fluid, oral mucosa, and supragingival biofilm). Results Analysis of the oral microbiota dynamics during allo-HSCT revealed a significant decline in bacterial diversity and major shifts in microbiota composition in all oral sites, including blooms of potentially pathogenic genera. These blooms in some cases preceded respiratory infections caused by the blooming genera. We also noticed that differences in microbiota diversity and composition between oral sites were lost during allo-HSCT. Overall, oral microbiotas returned to their preconditioning state after engraftment. However, the ability to recover the initial bacterial composition varied between patients. After stratifying patients based on their ability to recover their preconditioning microbiota composition, we found that recovery of the oral mucosa microbiota composition was not associated with antibiotic usage but was associated with higher preconditioning diversity and earlier reconstitution of normal leukocyte counts. Most notably, oral mucosa microbiota composition recovery was an independent biomarker of better allo-HSCT outcomes. Conclusion We observed clear patterns of microbiota dysbiosis in all three oral sites during allo-HSCT, however each oral site responded differently to the perturbations associated with allo-HSCT. Oral microbiota injury and recovery patterns were associated with allo-HSCT complications and outcomes. This study highlights the potential clinical impact of the oral microbiota in the allo-HSCT setting and the clinical value of tracking oral microbiota changes during allo-HSCT.

Collectively, our data reveal that the distribution of the microbiota within a tumour is not random; instead, it is highly organized in microniches with immune and epithelial cell functions that promote cancer progression.

However, many applications would benefit from a method that can sequence specific bacterial taxa of interest (pathogens, beneficial microbes, or low-abundance taxa), but not the vast background of other taxa in a microbiome sample. To address this need, we developed mEnrich-seq, a method that can enrich taxa of interest from metagenomic DNA before sequencing. The core idea is to exploit the self vs. non-self genome differentiation provided by natural bacterial DNA methylation and rationally choose methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes (REs), individually or in combination, to deplete host DNA and most background microbial DNA while enriching bacterial taxa of interest. This core idea is integrated with library preparation procedures in a way that only non-digested DNA libraries are sequenced. We performed in-depth evaluations of mEnrich-seq and demonstrated its use in several applications to enrich (up to 117-fold) genomic DNA of pathogenic or beneficial bacteria from human urine and fecal samples, including several species that are hard to culture or of low abundance. We also assessed the broad applicability of mEnrich-seq and found that 3130 (68.03%) of the 4601 strains with mapped methylomes to date can be targeted by at least one commercially available RE, representing 54.78% of the species examined in this analysis. mEnrich-seq provides microbiome researchers with a versatile and cost-effective approach for selective sequencing of diverse taxa of interest directly from the microbiome.

To understand the proliferation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) it is crucial to determine the factors that govern invasion of ARB into the river microbiome. Consequently, we here aim at elucidating how the resilience of the resident microbial communities against invasion by foreign ARB is affected by co-released stressors.
To achieve this, we grew natural microbial biofilms on glass slides in rivers for one month. The biofilms were then transferred to laboratory, recirculating flume systems and exposed to a single pulse of a model resistant invader bacterium (E. coli) either in presence or absence of stress induced by Cu2+. The invasion dynamics of E. coli into the biofilms were then monitored for 14 days. Despite an initially successful introduction of E. coli into the biofilms, independent of the imposed stress, over time the invader perished in absence of stress. However, under stress the invading strain successfully established and proliferated in the biofilms. Noteworthy, the increased establishment success of the invader coincided with a loss in microbial community diversity under stress conditions, likely due to additional niche space becoming available for the invader.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that the intrinsic resilience of the river microbiome towards invasion by ARB is strongly linked with maintaining diversity and that co-exposure to stressors that disrupt community diversity and structure increases long-term invasion success.

Yet, evidence linking microbiome-dependent energy harvest to particular human gut microbiome compositions have been lacking. In this recently published study, we investigated whether energy extraction from the diet in 85 overweight adults, estimated by dry stool energy density, was associated with intestinal transit time and variations in microbial community diversity and structure. We found opposite of what we expected that stool energy density was positively associated with intestinal transit time. Furthermore, individuals with a Bacteroides enterotype (B-type) had significantly lower energy left in faeces (per gram dried faeces) compared to individuals with a Ruminococcaecea enterotype (R-type). The B-type individuals had lower alpha-diversity and faster intestinal transit time, but also a significantly higher body weight compared to the R-type individuals. Furthermore, markers of proteolytic fermentation were increased in the R-type compared to the B-type. Together, this could suggest that human gut microbiome-dependent energy extraction is diversified according to intestinal transit time and gut microbiome ecosystem variations as reflected by enterotypes. While the causalities remain to be established, the observations are intriguing and could provide new dietary strategies in body weight management.
