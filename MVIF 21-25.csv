Following solid organ transplantation, tacrolimus (TAC) is an essential drug in the immunosuppressive strategy. Its use constitutes a challenge due to its narrow therapeutic index and its high inter- and intra- pharmacokinetic (PK) variability. As the contribution of the gut microbiota to drug metabolism is now emerging, it might be explored as one of the factors explaining TAC PK variability. Herein, we studied the contribution of the gut microbiota to TAC PK, using a combination of in vivo and in vitro models. Results. TAC oral administration was performed in mice. Compared to controls, mice with a lower intestinal microbial load due to antibiotics administration exhibit a 33% reduction in TAC whole blood exposure and a lower inter-individual variability. This reduction in TAC levels was strongly correlated with higher expression of the efflux transporter ABCB1 (also known as the p-glycoprotein (P-gp) or the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1)) in the small intestine. Conventionalization of germ-free mice confirmed the ability of the gut microbiota to downregulate ABCB1 expression in a site-specific fashion. The functional inhibition of ABCB1 in vivo by zosuquidar formally established the implication of this efflux transporter in the modulation of TAC PK by the gut microbiota. Furthermore, we showed that polar bacterial metabolites could recapitulate the transcriptional regulation of ABCB1 by the gut microbiota, without affecting its functionality. Finally, whole transcriptome analyses pinpointed, among others, the Constitutive Androstane Receptor (CAR) as a transcription factor likely to mediate the impact of the gut microbiota on ABCB1 transcriptional regulation. Conclusions. We highlight for the first time how the modulation of ABCB1 expression by bacterial metabolites results in changes in TAC PK, affecting not only blood levels but also the inter-individual variability. More broadly, considering the high number of drugs with unexplained PK variability transported by ABCB1, our work is of clinical importance and paves the way for incorporating the gut microbiota in prediction algorithms for dosage of such drugs.

Recently, we reported that the most prevalent Corynebacterium species found on skin, including Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum and Corynebacterium kefirresidentii, comprise a narrow species complex despite the diversity of the genus. Here, we apply high-resolution phylogenomics and comparative genomics to describe the structure of the C. tuberculostearicum species complex and highlight genetic traits which are enriched or depleted in it relative to other Corynebacterium. Through metagenomic investigations, we also find that individual species within the complex can associate with specific body sites. Finally, we discover that one species from the complex, C. kefirresidentii, increases in relative abundance during atopic dermatitis flares, and show that most genomes of this species encode a colocalized set of putative virulence genes.

Abstract of this talk: Allergic diseases affect millions of people worldwide. An increase in their prevalence has been associated with alterations in the gut microbiome, i.e., the microorganisms and their genes within the gastrointestinal tract. Maturation of the infant immune system and gut microbiota occur in parallel; thus, the conformation of the microbiome may determine if tolerant immune pro- gramming arises within the infant. Here we show, using deeply phenotyped participants in the CHILD birth cohort (n = 1115), that there are early-life influences and microbiome features which are uniformly associated with four distinct allergic diagnoses at 5 years: atopic dermatitis (AD, n = 367), asthma (As, n = 165), food allergy (FA, n = 136), and allergic rhinitis (AR, n = 187). In a subset with shotgun metagenomic and metabolomic profiling (n = 589), we discover that impaired 1-year microbiota maturation may be universal to pediatric allergies (AD p = 0.000014; As p = 0.0073; FA p = 0.00083; and AR p = 0.0021).

C. difficile infections (CDIs) are the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the U.S. and typically develop in individuals following disruption of the gut microbiota due to antibiotic or chemotherapy treatments. Further treatment of CDI with antibiotics is not always effective and can lead to antibiotic resistance and recurrent infections (rCDI). The most effective treatment for rCDI is the reestablishment of an intact microbiota via fecal microbiota transplants (FMTs). However, the success of FMTs has been difficult to generalize because the microbial interactions that prevent engraftment and facilitate the successful clearance of C. difficile are still only partially understood. Here we show how microbial community-scale metabolic models (MCMMs) accurately predicted known instances of C. difficile colonization susceptibility or resistance. MCMMs provide detailed mechanistic insights into the ecological interactions that govern C. difficile engraftment, like cross-feeding or competition involving metabolites like succinate, trehalose, and ornithine, which differ from person to person. Indeed, three distinct C. difficile metabolic niches emerge from our MCMMs, two associated with positive growth rates and one that represents non-growth, which are consistently observed across 14,862 individuals from four independent cohorts. Finally, we show how MCMMs can predict personalized engraftment and C. difficile growth suppression for a probiotic cocktail (VE303) designed to replace FMTs for the treatment rCDI. Overall, this powerful modeling approach predicts personalized C. difficile engraftment risk and can be leveraged to assess probiotic treatment efficacy. MCMMs could be extended to better understand personalized engraftment of other opportunistic bacterial pathogens, beneficial probiotic organisms, or more complex microbial consortia.

Sustainable aquaculture hinges on several factors, including the well-being of farmed fish, water quality, and feeds. A crucial step toward enhancing sustainability in aquaculture is the transition from fishmeal to alternative protein sources. Extensive research has focused on assessing innovative feed formulations, particularly their impact on the fish gut microbiome. However, limited studies have investigated the microbiome of the aquaculture built environment and host-environment microbiome interactions.
Here, we explored the aquaculture ecosystem microbiome when insect-based novel feed formulations are administered. Using 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of microbiomes across water, tank biofilm, fish intestinal mucus, fish cutis, and feed samples.
Our results showed that overall, water and the aquaculture built environment were characterised by an astounding microbial diversity.
Core microbiome analysis unveiled a highly reduced core shared among all sample sources, in both the control and novel feed test groups.
Network analysis demonstrated sample clustering based on sample source, with no significant variations tied to the feed formulation. Consequently, the different diets did not appear to impact the environment (water and tank biofilm) and fish (cutis and intestinal mucus) microbiomes. For a more detailed examination of the feed's contribution, we conducted a differential abundance analysis, revealing distinct enrichment/depletion of specific taxa when comparing the control to the insect-based diet group.
The results of this study highlight how the aquaculture environment is a unique source of microbes, able to colonise fish. Omic exploration of the water-fish interface exposes patterns that are otherwise undetected: subtle but significant differences in the abundance of specific taxa are exerted by feed.

Network analysis demonstrated sample clustering based on sample source, with no significant variations tied to the feed formulation. Consequently, the different diets did not appear to impact the environment (water and tank biofilm) and fish (cutis and intestinal mucus) microbiomes. For a more detailed examination of the feed's contribution, we conducted a differential abundance analysis, revealing distinct enrichment/depletion of specific taxa when comparing the control to the insect-based diet group.
The results of this study highlight how the aquaculture environment is a unique source of microbes, able to colonise fish. Omic exploration of the water-fish interface exposes patterns that are otherwise undetected: subtle but significant differences in the abundance of specific taxa are exerted by feed. A comprehensive grasp of aquaculture ecosystems as holobiomes is vital to design the built environment and modulate the microbial communities that are hosted for sustainable aquaculture."

Besides, compared to term infants, premature infants often receive antibiotics to treat infections and probiotics to restore optimal gut microbiota. How GA, antibiotics, and probiotics modulate the microbiota’s core characteristics, gut resistome and mobilome, remains nascent. Methods: We analysed metagenomic data from a longitudinal observational study in six Norwegian neonatal intensive care units to describe the bacterial microbiota of infants of varying GA and receiving different treatments. The cohort consisted of probiotic-supplemented and antibiotic-exposed extremely preterm infants (n = 29), antibiotic-exposed very preterm (n = 25), antibiotic-unexposed very preterm (n = 8), and antibiotic-unexposed full-term (n = 10) infants. The stool samples were collected on days of life 7, 28, 120, and 365, and DNA extraction was followed by shotgun metagenome sequencing and bioinformatical analysis. Findings: The top predictors of microbiota maturation were hospitalisation length and GA. Probiotic administration rendered the gut microbiota and resistome of extremely preterm infants more alike to term infants on day 7 and ameliorated GA-driven loss of microbiota interconnectivity and stability. GA, hospitalisation, and both microbiota-modifying treatments (antibiotics and probiotics) contributed to an elevated carriage of mobile genetic elements in preterm infants compared to term controls. Finally, Escherichia coli was associated with the highest number of antibiotic-resistance genes, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella aerogenes. Interpretation: Prolonged hospitalisation, antibiotics, and probiotic intervention contribute to dynamic alterations in resistome and mobilome, gut microbiota characteristics relevant to infection risk.

I am fascinated by the world of microbiomes and their potential role in human health and disease. Therefore, I am a link in a chain that focuses on fighting antibiotic resistance. So, without exaggeration, we are working to save the world from AMR danger that is projected to kill 10 million people by 2050. Pursuing my Ph.D. degree in Assoc. Prof. Veronika K. Petersen Lab at the Arctic University of Norway (UiT). Currently, my main project aims at understanding the effect of probiotics and antibiotics on the infants' gut microbiota, resistome, and mobilome composition using metagenomics approaches; besides integrating the metagenomics with the metabolome which is conducted by another Ph.D. candidate. While analyzing and collaborating on microbiome projects with bench researchers, clinicians, and scientists, I have realized that it is still very challenging for clinicians or bench researchers with no bioinformatics experience to handle, understand, and interpret this big omics data. The exploratory nature of data analysis makes the issue more complicated. Hence, my interest is to bridge this gap between data generation and data analysis skills. I have accepted invitations to collaborate on research with Professor Anne-Sofie Furberg at The Arctic University of Norway starting in February 2024, focusing on the prevalence and risk factors of antimicrobial resistance genes in Enterobacterales across a wide population. Additionally, from October 2023 to January 2024, I worked with Professor Yngvild Wasteson at NMBU on studies regarding the environmental dissemination of antibiotic-resistance genes and comparing different methodologies for identifying these genes. My tenure as a visiting researcher at Anne Salonen’s lab at the University of Helsinki from November to December 2023 involved conducting a comprehensive meta-analysis on the impact of early-life determinants on the gut resistome and mobilome of healthy, full-term infants.I have also contributed as an instructor for KJE-2004 Bioinformatics and R-for beginners courses, and am currently supervising two master's students researching the effects of travel, analgesic use, and proton pump inhibitors on the resistome, as well as the efficacy of various DNA extraction kits in identifying antibiotic resistance genes through quantitative PCR. During my master's, I worked on the evaluation of the impact of long-term amoxicillin administration on the human resistome using functional metagenomics. In the laboratory, I validated one of the discovered novel genes that could resist the PenicillinG at a MIC higher than the breakpoint reported by EUCAST by 300 times.

In particular, protists in the Parabasalia phylum reshape the intestinal immune landscape and influence host susceptibility to both infectious and inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanisms used by these protists to shape the gut environment remain poorly understood. Here, we identify a new species of commensal parabasalid in the mouse intestine, Tritrichomonas casperi. We find that metabolic differences between T. casperi and the closely related species Tritrichomonas musculis modulate their effects on host immunity and determine their ecological niche within the microbiota. First, we investigate metabolic output of these commensal parabasalids using genomic and metabolomic analysis. This reveals species-level differences in excretion of the tuft cell activating metabolite succinate, which causes differential remodeling of the immune system in the small intestine. Next, we investigate protist metabolic input by manipulating dietary fiber intake, as well as developing in vitro culture. This reveals that whereas T. musculis preferentially relies on dietary polysaccharides, T. casperi uses host mucus glycans as a carbon source. These carbon source preferences lead to differential competition with commensal bacteria in the intestine, including Bacteroidales spp. and Akkermansia muciniphila. These trans-kingdom interactions can in turn suppress protist-induced intestinal immune responses in a diet-dependent manner. Finally, we explore the diversity of commensal protists in humans by examining parabasalids in the microbiomes of both industrialized and non-industrialized populations. We identify multiple new species of commensal parabasalids in the microbiomes of non-industrialized populations, including novel human-associated tritrichomonads that are closely related T. musculis and T. casperi.

Abstract of this talk: Commensal protists have historically been overlooked as members of the gut microbiota, but recent studies have highlighted the dominant effects of these commensals on the gut ecosystem. In particular, protists in the Parabasalia phylum reshape the intestinal immune landscape and influence host susceptibility to both infectious and inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanisms used by these protists to shape the gut environment remain poorly understood. Here, we identify a new species of commensal parabasalid in the mouse intestine, Tritrichomonas casperi. We find that metabolic differences between T. casperi and the closely related species Tritrichomonas musculis modulate their effects on host immunity and determine their ecological niche within the microbiota. First, we investigate metabolic output of these commensal parabasalids using genomic and metabolomic analysis. This reveals species-level differences in excretion of the tuft cell activating metabolite succinate, which causes differential remodeling of the immune system in the small intestine. Next, we investigate protist metabolic input by manipulating dietary fiber intake, as well as developing in vitro culture. This reveals that whereas T. musculis preferentially relies on dietary polysaccharides, T. casperi uses host mucus glycans as a carbon source. These carbon source preferences lead to differential competition with commensal bacteria in the intestine, including Bacteroidales spp. and Akkermansia muciniphila. These trans-kingdom interactions can in turn suppress protist-induced intestinal immune responses in a diet-dependent manner. Finally, we explore the diversity of commensal protists in humans by examining parabasalids in the microbiomes of both industrialized and non-industrialized populations. We identify multiple new species of commensal parabasalids in the microbiomes of non-industrialized populations, including novel human-associated tritrichomonads that are closely related T. musculis and T. casperi. Altogether, our findings elucidate how commensal parabasalid metabolism acts as a focal point for complex interactions with the host immune system, commensal bacteria, and diet, to impact intestinal immunity and host health.

After completing her medical degree, she entered surgical residency training at the Massachusetts General Hospital where she became interested in the biology and treatment of cancer. During her training, she completed two fellowships in surgical oncology with a focus on cancer immunotherapy. She was recruited to MGH in 2008 to join the faculty in the Division of Surgical Oncology and established a translational research laboratory focusing on better understanding response and resistance to treatment for melanoma, pancreatic cancer, and other cancers. During that time, her laboratory demonstrated that treatment with molecularly targeted therapy could sensitize tumor cells to treatment with immunotherapy, providing the rationale for combined targeted therapy and immunotherapy combinations. She also began studies on the tumor microbiome in pancreatic and other cancers while at Harvard. Jen was recruited to the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in 2013 to help lead the Melanoma Moonshot efforts - and also continued important translational research work on targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and the impact of the gut and tumor microbiome in cancer. Jen is currently a Professor of Surgical Oncology and Genomic Medicine, and the leader of the Platform for Innovative Microbiome and Translational Research (PRIME-TR) at MD Anderson. Importantly, Jen is deeply invested in working with investigators across the institution and across the world to find better ways to treat, intercept, and ultimately prevent cancer.",Department of Surgical Oncology,Professor ,grid.240145.6,https://i.imgur.com/2RoKfwu.jpeg,"Title of the presentation: ""Targeting the microbiome to promote health and end cancer""

We assessed if samples collected noninvasively, in this case, from common cranes (Grus grus), can be used for fecal microbiome research, comparing microbiota of noninvasively collected fecal samples to those collected from trapped common cranes at the same sites over the same period.

We found significant differences in fecal microbial composition (alpha and beta diversity), which likely did not result from noninvasive samples’ exposure to soil contaminants, as assessed by comparing bacterial oxygen use profiles. Differences might result from trapped birds’ exposure to sedatives or stress. We conclude that if all samples are collected in the same manner, comparative analyses are valid, and noninvasive sampling may better represent host fecal microbiota because there are no trapping effects.

To illustrate this point, combining movement data from GPS-tagged cranes with noninvasively sampled fecal microbiota samples of birds spatiotemporally overlapping with the tagged birds, we find evidence that supports the role of diet in structuring bacterial communities. We also show that the wild bird gut microbiota undergoes not only seasonal shifts but is also affected by management schemes and local agricultural practices.

Experiments with fresh and delayed sample collection can elucidate effects of environmental exposures on microbiota. Further, controlled tests of stressing or sedation may unravel how trapping affects wildlife microbiota, but our application already shows how valuable this method can be.

The most common clinical presentation are abdominal tumours. An altered gut microbiome composition has been linked to multiple cancer types, and reported in murine models of neuroblastoma. However, whether children with neuroblastoma display alterations in gut microbiome composition remains unexplored.

Here, we assessed gut microbiome composition by shotgun metagenomic profiling in an observational cross-sectional study on 288 individuals, consisting of patients with a diagnosis of neuroblastoma at disease onset (N=63), healthy controls matching the patients on the main covariates of microbiome composition (N=94), healthy siblings of the patients (N=13), mothers of patients (N=59), and mothers of the controls (N=59). We examined taxonomic and functional microbiome composition and mother-infant strain transmission patterns. Patients with neuroblastoma displayed alterations in gut microbiome composition characterised by reduced microbiome richness, decreased relative abundances of 18 species (including Phocaeicola dorei and Bifidobacterium bifidum), enriched protein fermentation and reduced carbohydrate fermentation potential. Using machine learning, we could successfully discriminate patients from controls (AUC = 82%). Healthy siblings did not display such alterations but resembled the healthy control group. No significant differences in maternal microbiome composition nor mother-to-offspring transmission were detected.

Therefore, the alterations in taxonomic and functional gut microbiome composition we described in patients with neuroblastoma, cannot be traced to differential maternal seeding and might arise subsequently.
